	abstract = {Molecular mechanics is powerful for its speed in atomistic simulations, but an accurate force field is required. The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters were also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35\% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of φ and ψ parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the φ rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the β-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR χ1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.},

	abstract = {In this perspective, we review the theory and methodology of the derivation of force fields (FFs), and their validity, for molecular simulations, from their inception in the second half of the twentieth century to the improved representations at the end of the century. We examine the representations of the physics embodied in various force fields, their accuracy and deficiencies. The early days in the 1950s and 60s saw FFs first introduced to analyze vibrational spectra. The advent of computers was soon followed by the first molecular mechanics machine calculations. From the very first papers it was recognized that the accuracy with which the FFs represented the physics was critical if meaningful calculated structural and thermodynamic properties were to be achieved. We discuss the rigorous methodology formulated by Lifson, and later Allinger to derive molecular FFs, not only obtain optimal parameters but also uncover deficiencies in the representation of the physics and improve the functional form to account for this physics. In this context, the known coupling between valence coordinates and the importance of coupling terms to describe the physics of this coupling is evaluated. Early simplified, truncated FFs introduced to allow simulations of macromolecular systems are reviewed and their subsequent improvement assessed. We examine in some depth: the basis of the reformulation of the H-bond to its current description; the early introduction of QM in FF development methodology to calculate partial charges and rotational barriers; the powerful and abundant information provided by crystal structure and energetic observables to derive and test all aspects of a FF including both nonbond and intramolecular functional forms; the combined use of QM, along with crystallography and lattice energy calculations to derive rotational barriers about ɸ and ψ; the development and results of methodologies to derive “QM FFs” by sampling the QM energy surface, either by calculating energies at hundreds of configurations, or by describing the energy surface by energies, first and second derivatives sampled over the surface; and the use of the latter to probe the validity of the representations of the physics, reveal flaws and assess improved functional forms. Research demonstrating significant effects of the flaws in the use of the improper torsion angle to represent out of plane deformations, and the standard Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules for nonbonded interactions, and the more accurate descriptions presented are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the thorough studies involved in deriving the 2nd generation all-atom versions of the CHARMm, AMBER and OPLS FFs, and how the extensive set of observables used in these studies allowed, in the spirit of Lifson, a characterization of both the abilities, but more importantly the deficiencies in the diagonal 12-6-1 FFs used. The significant contribution made by the extensive set of observables compiled in these papers as a basis to test improved forms is noted. In the following paper, we discuss the progress in improving the FFs and representations of the physics that have been investigated in the years following the research described above.},

	abstract = {The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of α-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of “Amber” force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone φ/ψ dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the φ/ψ dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote ff99SB, achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to PDB survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental NMR relaxation data of test protein systems.

	abstract = {We present a method to identify small molecule ligand binding sites and poses within a given protein crystal structure using GPU-accelerated Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The Hamiltonians used vary from the physical end state of protein interacting with the ligand to an unphysical end state where the ligand does not interact with the protein. As replicas explore the space of Hamiltonians interpolating between these states, the ligand can rapidly escape local minima and explore potential binding sites. Geometric restraints keep the ligands from leaving the vicinity of the protein and an alchemical pathway designed to increase phase space overlap between intermediates ensures good mixing. Because of the rigorous statistical mechanical nature of the Hamiltonian exchange framework, we can also extract binding free energy estimates for all putative binding sites. We present results of this methodology applied to the T4 lysozyme L99A model system for three known ligands and one non-binder as a control, using an implicit solvent. We find that our methodology identifies known crystallographic binding sites consistently and accurately for the small number of ligands considered here and gives free energies consistent with experiment. We are also able to analyze the contribution of individual binding sites to the overall binding affinity. Our methodology points to near term potential applications in early-stage structure-guided drug discovery.},

After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions, as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also discussed in the chapter.},

In this sense, the results represent a solution to the classical protein-folding problem, at least for single proteins. The models have already been shown to be capable of providing solutions for problematic crystal structures, and there are broad implications for the rest of structural biology. Other research groups also substantially improved performance. Here, we describe these results and outline some of the many implications.

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Using only sequence information, successful Rosetta predictions yield models with typical accuracies of 3–6 A˚ Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the experimentally determined structures for contiguous segments of 60 or more residues. For each structure prediction, many short simulations starting from different random seeds are carried out to generate an ensemble of decoy structures that have both favorable local interactions and protein-like global properties. This set is then clustered by structural similarity to identify the broadest free energy minima.

Important advances are reported in modeling protein-ligand energetics, such as the incorporation of electronic polarization and the use of quantum mechanical methods. Recent calculations suggest that changes in configurational entropy strongly oppose binding and must be included if accurate affinities are to be obtained. The linear interaction energy (LIE) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods are analyzed, as are free energy pathway methods, which show promise and may be ready for more extensive testing.

Absolute binding free energies, as well as binding free energies relative to another molecule with a different net charge will be affected by artifacts due to the used effective electrostatic interaction function and associated parameters (e.g., size of the computational box). In the present study, charging contributions to binding free energies of small oligoatomic ions to a series of model host cavities functionalized with different chemical groups are calculated with classical atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Electrostatic interactions are treated using a lattice-summation scheme or a cutoff-truncation scheme with Barker–Watts reaction-field correction, and the simulations are conducted in boxes of different edge lengths. It is illustrated that the charging free energies of the guest molecules in water and in the host strongly depend on the applied methodology and that neglect of correction terms for the artifacts introduced by the finite size of the simulated system and the use of an effective electrostatic interaction function considerably impairs the thermodynamic interpretation of guest-host interactions. Application of correction terms for the various artifacts yields consistent results for the charging contribution to binding free energies and is thus a prerequisite for the valid interpretation or prediction of experimental data via molecular dynamics simulation. Analysis and correction of electrostatic artifacts according to the scheme proposed in the present study should therefore be considered an integral part of careful free-energy calculation studies if changes in the net charge are involved. © 2013 The Authors Journal of Computational Chemistry Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Adequate sampling of conformation space remains challenging in atomistic simulations, especially if the solvent is treated explicitly. Implicit-solvent simulations can speed up conformational sampling significantly. We compare the speed of conformational sampling between two commonly used methods of each class: the explicit-solvent particle mesh Ewald (PME) with TIP3P water model and a popular generalized Born (GB) implicit-solvent model, as implemented in the AMBER package. We systematically investigate small (dihedral angle flips in a protein), large (nucleosome tail collapse and DNA unwrapping), and mixed (folding of a miniprotein) conformational changes, with nominal simulation times ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds depending on system size. The speedups in conformational sampling for GB relative to PME simulations, are highly system- and problem-dependent. Where the simulation temperatures for PME and GB are the same, the corresponding speedups are approximately onefold (small conformational changes), between ∼1- and ∼100-fold (large changes), and approximately sevenfold (mixed case). The effects of temperature on speedup and free-energy landscapes, which may differ substantially between the solvent models, are discussed in detail for the case of miniprotein folding. In addition to speeding up conformational sampling, due to algorithmic differences, the implicit solvent model can be computationally faster for small systems or slower for large systems, depending on the number of solute and solvent atoms. For the conformational changes considered here, the combined speedups are approximately twofold, ∼1- to 60-fold, and ∼50-fold, respectively, in the low solvent viscosity regime afforded by the implicit solvent. For all the systems studied, 1) conformational sampling speedup increases as Langevin collision frequency (effective viscosity) decreases; and 2) conformational sampling speedup is mainly due to reduction in solvent viscosity rather than possible differences in free-energy landscapes between the solvent models.},

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics simulations offer a computational approach to study the behavior of biomolecules at atomic detail, but such simulations are limited in size and timescale by the available computing resources. State-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) can perform over 500 billion arithmetic operations per second, a tremendous computational resource that can now be utilized for general purpose computing as a result of recent advances in GPU hardware and software architecture. In this article, an overview of recent advances in programmable GPUs is presented, with an emphasis on their application to molecular mechanics simulations and the programming techniques required to obtain optimal performance in these cases. We demonstrate the use of GPUs for the calculation of long-range electrostatics and nonbonded forces for molecular dynamics simulations, where GPU-based calculations are typically 10–100 times faster than heavily optimized CPU-based implementations. The application of GPU acceleration to biomolecular simulation is also demonstrated through the use of GPU-accelerated Coulomb-based ion placement and calculation of time-averaged potentials from molecular dynamics trajectories. A novel approximation to Coulomb potential calculation, the multilevel summation method, is introduced and compared with direct Coulomb summation. In light of the performance obtained for this set of calculations, future applications of graphics processors to molecular dynamics simulations are discussed. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The dynamics of CO or O2 binding to myoglobin are examined theoretically with particular emphasis on the effect of the globin on the barriers along possible reaction paths. By use of a diabatic representation, in which a model ligand moves in the potential of a rigid protein, two paths in or out of the heme pocket are found in myoglobin; one is by the E helix near the distal histidine and the other near the intersection of the B, D and E helices. Classical trajectories calculated for a photo-dissociated ligand in the diabatic approximation yield complicated motion; the ligand tends to spend considerable time undergoing multiple collisions with the protein matrix in the wells between barriers. To investigate the height of the barriers, the adiabatic limit is used; that is, the protein is allowed to relax in the presence of a perturbation due to the ligand-protein interaction. A detailed description is obtained for the displacements of residues required for the ligand to enter or leave the globin. The barrier heights calculated in this manner are found to be in qualitative agreement with observed values. Some differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin are described. Although the present calculations make use of a simplified model of the ligand-myoglobin system, they provide a useful first step in the analysis of the effect of the globin matrix on the binding process.},

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

The overall Cα root-mean-square deviation from the average for 16 calculated structures is 1·8(±0·2)Å, but excluding 14 residues in exposed disordered regions, this value reduces to 1·3(±0·2) Å. Regions of secondary structure and the four α-helices in particular, are well defined (Cα root-mean-square deviation 0·8(±0·3) Å for helices). The main-chain fold is closely similar to structures of the protein in the crystalline state. Furthermore, many of the internal side-chains are found in well-defined conformational states in the solution structures, and these correspond well with the conformational states found in the crystal. The general high level of definition of main-chain and many internal side-chains in the solution structures is reinforced by the results of an analysis of coupling constants and ring current shifts. Many side-chains on the surface, however, are highly disordered amongst the set of solution structures. In certain cases this disorder has been shown to be dynamic in origin by the examination of 3Jαβ coupling constants.},

In those cases the interpretation of NMR relaxation data is difficult and the use of standard methods for structure determination is questionable. On the other hand, in the case of those system sizes, the timescale of both rotational and internal motions is accessible by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using explicit solvent. Thus a comparison of distance averages (〈r−6〉−1/6 or 〈r−3〉1/3) over the MD trajectory with NOE (or ROE) derived distances is no longer necessary, the (back)calculation of the complete spectra becomes possible. In the present study we use two 200 ns trajectories of a heptapeptide of β-amino acids in methanol at two different temperatures to obtain theoretical ROESY spectra by calculating the exact spectral densities for the interproton vectors and the full relaxation matrix. Those data are then compared with the experimental ones. This analysis permits to test some of the assumptions and approximations that generally have to be made to interpret NMR spectra, and to make a more reliable prediction of the conformational equilibrium that leads to the experimental spectrum.},

In particular, the influence of simulation boxes defined by the near-densest lattice packing (NDLP) in conjunction with rotational constraints is compared to that of standard box types without these constraints. Three different proteins of varying size, shape, and secondary structure content were examined in the study. The statistical significance of differences in RMSD, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface, number of hydrogen bonds, and secondary structure content between proteins, box types, and the application or not of rotational constraints has been assessed. Furthermore, the differences in the collective modes for each protein between different boxes and the application or not of rotational constraints have been examined. In total 105 simulations were performed, and the results compared using a three-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for properties derived from the trajectories and a three-way univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) for collective modes. It is shown that application of roto-translational constraints does not have a statistically significant effect on the results obtained from the different simulations. However, the choice of simulation box was found to have a small (5–10\%), but statistically significant effect on the behavior of two of the three proteins included in the study. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many systems of interest are highly complex, often at the edge of current computational capabilities. Modelers must therefore analyze and communicate statistical uncertainties so that "consumers'' of simulated data understand its significance and limitations. This article covers key analyses appropriate for trajectory data generated by conventional simulation methods such as molecular dynamics and (single Markov chain) Monte Carlo. It also provides guidance for analyzing some "enhanced" sampling approaches. We do not discuss systematic errors arising, e.g., from inaccuracy in the chosen model or force field.},

	abstract = {Computer simulation of molecular systems enables structure–energy–function relationships of molecular processes to be described at the sub-atomic, atomic, supra-atomic, or supra-molecular level. To interpret results of such simulations appropriately, the quality of the calculated properties must be evaluated. This depends on the way the simulations are performed and on the way they are validated by comparison to values Qexp of experimentally observable quantities Q. One must consider 1) the accuracy of Qexp, 2) the accuracy of the function Q(rN) used to calculate a Q-value based on a molecular configuration rN of N particles, 3) the sensitivity of the function Q(rN) to the configuration rN, 4) the relative time scales of the simulation and experiment, 5) the degree to which the calculated and experimental properties are equivalent, and 6) the degree to which the system simulated matches the experimental conditions. Experimental data is limited in scope and generally corresponds to averages over both time and space. A critical analysis of the various factors influencing the apparent degree of (dis)agreement between simulations and experiment is presented and illustrated using examples from the literature. What can be done to enhance the validation of molecular simulation is also discussed.},

	abstract = {A traditional technique for structure-based drug design (SBDD) is mapping of protein surfaces with probe molecules to identify “hot spots” where key functional groups can best complement the receptor. Common methods, such as minimization of probes or calculation of grids, use a fixed protein structure in the gas phase, ignoring both protein flexibility and proper competition between the probes and water. As a result, the potential surface is quite rugged, and many spurious local minima are identified. In this work, we compared rigid and fully flexible proteins in mixed-solvent molecular dynamics, which allows for flexibility and full solvent effects. We were surprised to find that the large number of local minima are still found when a protein’s conformational sampling is restricted; the dynamic averaging of probes and competition with water do not smooth the potential surface as one might expect. Only when a protein is allowed to be fully flexible in the simulation are the proper minima located and the spurious ones eliminated. Our results indicate that inclusion of full protein flexibility is critical to accurate hot-spot mapping for SBDD.},

	abstract = {The positions of the ordered hydrogen isotopes of a protein and its bound solvent can be determined by using neutron crystallography. Furthermore, by collecting neutron data at cryo temperatures, the dynamic disorder within a protein crystal is reduced, which may lead to improved definition of the nuclear density. It has proved possible to cryo-cool very large Con A protein crystals ({\textgreater}1.5 mm3) suitable for high-resolution neutron and x-ray structure analysis. We can thereby report the neutron crystal structure of the saccharide-free form of Con A and its bound water, including 167 intact D2O molecules and 60 oxygen atoms at 15 K to 2.5-Å resolution, along with the 1.65-Å x-ray structure of an identical crystal at 100 K. Comparison with the 293-K neutron structure shows that the bound water molecules are better ordered and have lower average B factors than those at room temperature. Overall, twice as many bound waters (as D2O) are identified at 15 K than at 293 K. We note that alteration of bound water orientations occurs between 293 and 15 K; such changes, as illustrated here with this example, could be important more generally in protein crystal structure analysis and ligand design. Methodologically, this successful neutron cryo protein structure refinement opens up categories of neutron protein crystallography, including freeze-trapped structures and cryo to room temperature comparisons.},

This trend towards the study of larger systems using smaller samples is set to continue with instrumentation being built at new sources and upgrades being made to existing instrumentation. These developments make it desirable to summarize the current status of neutron macromolecular crystallography and offer some perspectives for the future. In addition, using examples of the neutron structures determined so far, I will present the wealth of information that can be gained from such studies and illustrate how this can be vital towards understanding macromolecular function and behaviour.},

Examination of the enzyme and enzyme-ligand structures indicates a key role of multiple tautomerizations of asparagine residues and peptide bonds, which are finally connected to the other catalytic residue via typical side-chain hydrogen bonds, in forming the “Newton’s cradle”–like proton relay pathway of the catalytic cycle. Amide–imidic acid tautomerization of asparagine has not been taken into account in recent molecular dynamics simulations of not only cellulases but also general enzyme catalysis, and it may be necessary to reconsider our interpretation of many enzymatic reactions.},

The PTPs, YopH and PTP1B, have very different catalytic rates; however, we find in both that the active-site loop closes to its catalytically competent position at rates that mirror the phosphotyrosine cleavage kinetics. This loop contains the catalytic acid, suggesting that loop closure occurs concomitantly with the protonation of the leaving group tyrosine and explains the different kinetics of two otherwise chemically and mechanistically indistinguishable enzymes.},

Although protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has emerged as a promising target for the treatment of both syndromes, the discovery of pharmaceutically acceptable inhibitors that bind at the active site remains a substantial challenge. Here we describe the discovery of an allosteric site in PTP1B. Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with allosteric inhibitors reveal a novel site located ∼20 Å from the catalytic site. We show that allosteric inhibitors prevent formation of the active form of the enzyme by blocking mobility of the catalytic loop, thereby exploiting a general mechanism used by tyrosine phosphatases. Notably, these inhibitors exhibit selectivity for PTP1B and enhance insulin signaling in cells. Allosteric inhibition is a promising strategy for targeting PTP1B and constitutes a mechanism that may be applicable to other tyrosine phosphatases.},

A clearer understanding of this intrinsic circuitry would afford new opportunities to modulate protein function. Here, we have identified allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) by combining multiple-temperature X-ray crystallography experiments and structure determination from hundreds of individual small-molecule fragment soaks. New modeling approaches reveal 'hidden' low-occupancy conformational states for protein and ligands. Our results converge on allosteric sites that are conformationally coupled to the active-site WPD loop and are hotspots for fragment binding. Targeting one of these sites with covalently tethered molecules or mutations allosterically inhibits enzyme activity. Overall, this work demonstrates how the ensemble nature of macromolecular structure, revealed here by multitemperature crystallography, can elucidate allosteric mechanisms and open new doors for long-range control of protein function.},

Time-resolved X-ray methods hold promise for addressing this challenge, but have relied on the exploitation of exotic protein photoactivity, and are therefore not generalizable. Temperature jumps, through thermal excitation of the solvent, have been utilized to study protein dynamics using spectroscopic techniques, but their implementation in X-ray scattering experiments has been limited. Here, we perform temperature-jump small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements on a dynamic enzyme, cyclophilin A, demonstrating that these experiments are able to capture functional intramolecular protein dynamics on the microsecond timescale. We show that cyclophilin A displays rich dynamics following a temperature jump, and use the resulting time-resolved signal to assess the kinetics of conformational changes. Two relaxation processes are resolved: a fast process is related to surface loop motions, and a slower process is related to motions in the core of the protein that are critical for catalytic turnover.},

	abstract = {X-ray diffraction has the potential to provide rich information about the structural dynamics of macromolecules. To realize this potential, both Bragg scattering, which is currently used to derive macromolecular structures, and diffuse scattering, which reports on correlations in charge density variations, must be measured. Until now, measurement of diffuse scattering from protein crystals has been scarce because of the extra effort of collecting diffuse data. Here, we present 3D measurements of diffuse intensity collected from crystals of the enzymes cyclophilin A and trypsin. The measurements were obtained from the same X-ray diffraction images as the Bragg data, using best practices for standard data collection. To model the underlying dynamics in a practical way that could be used during structure refinement, we tested translation–libration–screw (TLS), liquid-like motions (LLM), and coarse-grained normal-modes (NM) models of protein motions. The LLM model provides a global picture of motions and was refined against the diffuse data, whereas the TLS and NM models provide more detailed and distinct descriptions of atom displacements, and only used information from the Bragg data. Whereas different TLS groupings yielded similar Bragg intensities, they yielded different diffuse intensities, none of which agreed well with the data. In contrast, both the LLM and NM models agreed substantially with the diffuse data. These results demonstrate a realistic path to increase the number of diffuse datasets available to the wider biosciences community and indicate that dynamics-inspired NM structural models can simultaneously agree with both Bragg and diffuse scattering.},

	abstract = {Determining the interconverting conformations of dynamic proteins in atomic detail is a major challenge for structural biology. Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function, but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The diffraction-before-destruction nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA, confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above, yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-–240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model, in which exchange between rotamer states of a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network. Together, our multitemperature analyses and XFEL data motivate a new generation of temperature- and time-resolved experiments to structurally characterize the dynamic underpinnings of protein function.},

	abstract = {The considerable flexibility of side-chains in folded proteins is important for protein stability and function, and may have a role in mediating allosteric interactions. While sampling side-chain degrees of freedom has been an integral part of several successful computational protein design methods, the predictions of these approaches have not been directly compared to experimental measurements of side-chain motional amplitudes. In addition, protein design methods frequently keep the backbone fixed, an approximation that may substantially limit the ability to accurately model side-chain flexibility. Here, we describe a Monte Carlo approach to modeling side-chain conformational variability and validate our method against a large dataset of methyl relaxation order parameters derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments (17 proteins and a total of 530 data points). We also evaluate a model of backbone flexibility based on Backrub motions, a type of conformational change frequently observed in ultra-high-resolution X-ray structures that accounts for correlated side-chain backbone movements. The fixed-backbone model performs reasonably well with an overall rmsd between computed and predicted side-chain order parameters of 0.26. Notably, including backbone flexibility leads to significant improvements in modeling side-chain order parameters for ten of the 17 proteins in the set. Greater accuracy of the flexible backbone model results from both increases and decreases in side-chain flexibility relative to the fixed-backbone model. This simple flexible-backbone model should be useful for a variety of protein design applications, including improved modeling of protein–protein interactions, design of proteins with desired flexibility or rigidity, and prediction of correlated motions within proteins.},

Furthermore, because of the direct comparison against experimental data, they can inform assessment of molecular dynamics methods and force fields. We present microsecond scale results for triclinic hen egg-white lysozyme in a supercell consisting of 12 independent unit cells using four contemporary force fields (Amber ff99SB, ff14ipq, ff14SB, and CHARMM 36) in crystalline and solvated states (for ff14SB only). We find the crystal simulations consistent across multiple runs of the same force field and robust to various solvent equilibration schemes. However, convergence is slow compared with solvent simulations. All the tested force fields reproduce experimental structural and dynamic properties well, but Amber ff14SB maintains structure and reproduces fluctuations closest to the experimental model: its average backbone structure differs from the deposited structure by 0.37Å; by contrast, the average backbone structure in solution differs from the deposited by 0.65Å. All the simulations are affected by a small progressive deterioration of the crystal lattice, presumably due to imperfect modeling of hydrogen bonding and other crystal contact interactions; this artifact is smallest in ff14SB, with average lattice positions deviating by 0.20Å from ideal. Side-chain disorder is surprisingly low with fewer than 30\% of the nonglycine or alanine residues exhibiting significantly populated alternate rotamers. Our results provide helpful insight into the methodology of biomolecular crystal simulations and indicate directions for future work to obtain more accurate energy models for molecular dynamics.},

	abstract = {X-ray crystallography is the predominant method for macromolecular structure determination. In this method, crystals are illuminated with intense X-ray radiation that damages the crystal. If crystals are cooled to cryogenic temperatures, the effects of radiation damage are greatly reduced. Since protein crystals are aqueous, cryocooling creates the possibility of crystalline ice formation. X-ray diffraction from ice is difficult to disentangle from the protein diffraction and if the ice is internal to the protein crystal, the expansion of solvent into ice degrades the crystal's order and subsequent diffraction quality. While there has been significant research into how to prevent ice formation, there has been very little research into the basic science of ice formation in macromolecular crystallography. The solvent within protein crystals is nanoconfined so the ice formation process should differ significantly from bulk-like solvent. Many open questions remain, such as what is a protein crystal's freezing point? Once the crystal has been cooled below this temperature, how long does it take for ice to form? When ice does form, what is its structure and how much solvent at the protein's surface is restricted from crystallizing? We performed experiments studying the ice formation process inside of protein crystals. The results from these experiments showed that freezing points are depressed, the structure of ice is stacking disordered and two monolayers of water remain uncrystallized at the protein's surface. Completely new results from our experiments show protein crystals can remain supercooled for 10's of seconds suggesting a dramatic suppression of ice nucleation rates unobserved in any other material. A novel observation was made while performing these experiments, following an expected initial contraction on cooling to temperatures as low as 220 K, apoferritin crystals expand to volumes as large or larger than their volumes at room-temperature. This serves as further evidence that the solvent inside of the protein crystals is in liquid form at temperatures above the protein-solvent glass transition. Using data deposited to the Protein Data Bank and the Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography, we show that crystals with larger solvent cavities and percent solvent content are more susceptible to ice formation and the prevalence of hexagonal like ice has dramatically increased in the last 10 years.},

	abstract = {We use classical molecular dynamics and 16 combinations of force fields and water models to simulate a protein crystal observed by room-temperature X-ray diffraction. The high resolution of the diffraction data (0.96 Å) and the simplicity of the crystallization solution (nearly pure water) make it possible to attribute any inconsistencies between the crystal structure and our simulations to artifacts of the models rather than inadequate representation of the crystal environment or uncertainty in the experiment. All simulations were extended for 100 ns of production dynamics, permitting some long-time scale artifacts of each model to emerge. The most noticeable effect of these artifacts is a model-dependent drift in the unit cell dimensions, which can become as large as 5\% in certain force fields; the underlying cause is the replacement of native crystallographic contacts with non-native ones, which can occur with heterogeneity (loss of crystallographic symmetry) in simulations with some force fields. We find that the AMBER FF99SB force field maintains a lattice structure nearest that seen in the X-ray data, and produces the most realistic atomic fluctuations (by comparison to crystallographic B-factors) of all the models tested. We find that the choice of water model has a minor effect in comparison to the choice of protein model. We also identify a number of artifacts that occur throughout all of the simulations: excessive formation of hydrogen bonds or salt bridges between polar groups and loss of hydrophobic interactions. This study is intended as a foundation for future work that will identify individual parameters in each molecular model that can be modified to improve their representations of protein structure and thermodynamics.},

We used the resulting MD trajectories to simulate X-ray diffraction and to study collective motions. The agreement of simulated X-ray diffraction with the data is comparable to previous MD simulation studies. We studied collective motions by analyzing statistically the covariance of alpha-carbon position displacements. The covariance decreases exponentially with the distance between atoms, which is consistent with a liquidlike motions (LLM) model, in which the protein behaves like a soft material. To gain finer insight into the collective motions, we examined the covariance behavior within a protein molecule (intraprotein) and between different protein molecules (interprotein). The interprotein atom pairs, which dominate the overall statistics, exhibit LLM behavior; however, the intraprotein pairs exhibit behavior that is consistent with a superposition of LLM and rigid-body motions (RBM). Our results indicate that LLM behavior of global dynamics is present in MD simulations of a protein crystal. They also show that RBM behavior is detectable in the simulations but that it is subsumed by the LLM behavior. Finally, the results provide clues about how correlated motions of atom pairs both within and across proteins might manifest in diffraction data. Overall, our findings increase our understanding of the connection between molecular motions and diffraction data and therefore advance efforts to extract information about functionally important motions from crystallography experiments.},

The information in Bragg scattering is limited to what is available in the mean electron density. The diffuse scattering arises from correlations in the electron density variations and therefore contains information about collective motions in proteins. Previous studies using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to model diffuse scattering have been hindered by insufficient sampling of the conformational ensemble. To overcome this issue, we have performed a 1.1-μs MD simulation of crystalline staphylococcal nuclease, providing 100-fold more sampling than previous studies. This simulation enables reproducible calculations of the diffuse intensity and predicts functionally important motions, including transitions among at least eight metastable states with different active-site geometries. The total diffuse intensity calculated using the MD model is highly correlated with the experimental data. In particular, there is excellent agreement for the isotropic component of the diffuse intensity, and substantial but weaker agreement for the anisotropic component. Decomposition of the MD model into protein and solvent components indicates that protein–solvent interactions contribute substantially to the overall diffuse intensity. We conclude that diffuse scattering can be used to validate predictions from MD simulations and can provide information to improve MD models of protein motions.},

A long-standing goal of X-ray crystallography has been to combine structural information from Bragg diffraction with dynamic information contained in the diffuse scattering background. However, the origin of macromolecular diffuse scattering has been poorly understood, limiting its applicability. We present a finely sampled diffuse scattering map from triclinic lysozyme with unprecedented accuracy and detail, clearly resolving both the inter- and intramolecular correlations. These correlations are studied theoretically using both all-atom molecular dynamics and simple vibrational models. Although lattice dynamics reproduce most of the diffuse pattern, protein internal dynamics, which include hinge-bending motions, are needed to explain the short-ranged correlations revealed by Patterson analysis. These insights lay the groundwork for animating crystal structures with biochemically relevant motions.},

	abstract = {Detailed descriptions of atomic coordinates and motions are required for an understanding of protein dynamics and their relation to molecular recognition, catalytic function, and allostery. Historically, NMR relaxation measurements have played a dominant role in the determination of the amplitudes and timescales (picosecond–nanosecond) of bond vector fluctuations, whereas high-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments can reveal the presence of and provide atomic coordinates for multiple, weakly populated substates in the protein conformational ensemble. Here we report a hybrid NMR and X-ray crystallography analysis that provides a more complete dynamic picture and a more quantitative description of the timescale and amplitude of fluctuations in atomic coordinates than is obtainable from the individual methods alone. Order parameters (S2) were calculated from single-conformer and multiconformer models fitted to room temperature and cryogenic X-ray diffraction data for dihydrofolate reductase. Backbone and side-chain order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments are in excellent agreement with those calculated from the room-temperature single-conformer and multiconformer models, showing that the picosecond timescale motions observed in solution occur also in the crystalline state. These motions are quenched in the crystal at cryogenic temperatures. The combination of NMR and X-ray crystallography in iterative refinement promises to provide an atomic resolution description of the alternate conformational substates that are sampled through picosecond to nanosecond timescale fluctuations of the protein structure. The method also provides insights into the structural heterogeneity of nonmethyl side chains, aromatic residues, and ligands, which are less commonly analyzed by NMR relaxation measurements.},

	abstract = {Although proteins populate large structural ensembles, X-ray diffraction data are traditionally interpreted using a single model. To search for evidence of alternate conformers, we developed a program, Ringer, which systematically samples electron density around the dihedral angles of protein side chains. In a diverse set of 402 structures, Ringer identified weak, nonrandom electron-density features that suggest of the presence of hidden, lowly populated conformations for {\textgreater}18\% of uniquely modeled residues. Although these peaks occur at electron-density levels traditionally regarded as noise, statistically significant (P {\textless} 10−5) enrichment of peaks at successive rotameric χ angles validates the assignment of these features as unmodeled conformations. Weak electron density corresponding to alternate rotamers also was detected in an accurate electron density map free of model bias. Ringer analysis of the high-resolution structures of free and peptide-bound calmodulin identified shifts in ensembles and connected the alternate conformations to ligand recognition. These results show that the signal in high-resolution electron density maps extends below the traditional 1 σ cutoff, and crystalline proteins are more polymorphic than current crystallographic models. Ringer provides an objective, systematic method to identify previously undiscovered alternate conformations that can mediate protein folding and function.},

	abstract = {All published rotamer libraries contain some rotamers that exhibit impossible internal atomic overlaps if built in ideal geometry with all hydrogen atoms. Removal of uncertain residues (mainly those with B-factors ≥40 or van der Waals overlaps ≥0.4 Å) greatly improves the clustering of rotamer populations. Asn, Gln, or His side chains additionally benefit from flipping of their planar terminal groups when required by atomic overlaps or H-bonding. Sensitivity to skew and to the boundaries of χ angle bins is avoided by using modes rather than traditional mean values. Rotamer definitions are listed both as the modal values and in a preferred version that maximizes common atoms between related rotamers. The resulting library shows significant differences from previous ones, differences validated by considering the likelihood of systematic misfitting of models to electron density maps and by plotting changes in rotamer frequency with B-factor. Few rotamers now show atomic overlaps in ideal geometry; those overlaps are relatively small and can be understood in terms of bond angle distortions compensated by favorable interactions. The new library covers 94.5\% of examples in the highest quality protein data with 153 rotamers and can make a significant contribution to improving the accuracy of new structures.

There have been many infrastructure improvements, including rewrite of previous Java utilities to now use existing or newly written Python utilities in the open-source CCTBX portion of the Phenix software system. This improves long-term maintainability and enhances the thorough integration of MolProbity-style validation within Phenix. There is now a complete MolProbity mirror site at http://molprobity.manchester.ac.uk. GitHub serves our open-source code, reference datasets, and the resulting multi-dimensional distributions that define most validation criteria. Coordinate output after Asn/Gln/His “flip” correction is now more idealized, since the post-refinement step has apparently often been skipped in the past. Two distinct sets of heavy-atom-to-hydrogen distances and accompanying van der Waals radii have been researched and improved in accuracy, one for the electron-cloud-center positions suitable for X-ray crystallography and one for nuclear positions. New validations include messages at input about problem-causing format irregularities, updates of Ramachandran and rotamer criteria from the million quality-filtered residues in a new reference dataset, the CaBLAM Cα-CO virtual-angle analysis of backbone and secondary structure for cryoEM or low-resolution X-ray, and flagging of the very rare cis-nonProline and twisted peptides which have recently been greatly overused. Due to wide application of MolProbity validation and corrections by the research community, in Phenix, and at the worldwide Protein Data Bank, newly deposited structures have continued to improve greatly as measured by MolProbity's unique all-atom clashscore.},

	abstract = {Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of Bragg and diffuse X-ray scattering provide a means of obtaining experimentally validated models of protein conformational ensembles. This paper shows that compared with a single periodic unit-cell model, the accuracy of simulating diffuse scattering is increased when the crystal is modeled as a periodic supercell consisting of a 2 × 2 × 2 layout of eight unit cells. The MD simulations capture the general dependence of correlations on the separation of atoms. There is substantial agreement between the simulated Bragg reflections and the crystal structure; there are local deviations, however, indicating both the limitation of using a single structure to model disordered regions of the protein and local deviations of the average structure away from the crystal structure. Although it was anticipated that a simulation of longer duration might be required to achieve maximal agreement of the diffuse scattering calculation with the data using the supercell model, only a microsecond is required, the same as for the unit cell. Rigid protein motions only account for a minority fraction of the variation in atom positions from the simulation. The results indicate that protein crystal dynamics may be dominated by internal motions rather than packing interactions, and that MD simulations can be combined with Bragg and diffuse X-ray scattering to model the protein conformational ensemble.},

Ambiguous (‘weak’ or ‘noisy’) density is experimentally common, since molecular states are generally only fractionally present in the crystal. Existing methodologies focus on generating maximally accurate maps whereby minor states become discernible; in practice, such map interpretation is disappointingly subjective, time-consuming and methodologically unsound. Here we report the PanDDA method, which automatically reveals clear electron density for the changed state—even from inaccurate maps—by subtracting a proportion of the confounding ‘ground state’; changed states are objectively identified from statistical analysis of density distributions. The method is completely general, implying new best practice for all changed-state studies, including the routine collection of multiple ground-state crystals. More generally, these results demonstrate: the incompleteness of atomic models; that single data sets contain insufficient information to model them fully; and that accuracy requires further map-deconvolution approaches.},

To accomplish this, new methods and inevitably new software must be developed to accelerate the process of structure solution. To minimize duplication of effort and to generate maintainable code efficiently, a toolbox of basic crystallographic software components is required. The development of the Computational Crystallography Toolbox (cctbx) has been undertaken for this purpose. In this paper, the fundamental requirements for the cctbx are outlined and the decisions that have lead to its implementation are explained. The cctbx currently contains algorithms for the handling of unit cells, space groups and atomic scatterers, and is released under an Open Source license to allow unrestricted use and continued development. It will be developed further to become a comprehensive library of crystallographic tools useful to the entire community of software developers.},

Although there are no experimental methods to measure the full protein conformational distribution, several methods exist to probe important aspects. Diffuse X-ray scattering is one such method. We have measured the first three-dimensional reciprocal-space maps of the intensity of diffuse X-ray reflections from protein crystals, and used them to characterize protein conformational distributions. With straightforward modifications, X-ray beamlines can be engineered to enable diffuse scattering measurements for protein crystals. To facilitate future studies, the Lunus software package, used to create the first three-dimensional maps of diffuse X-ray reflections from protein crystals, has been made publicly available (http://lunus.sourceforge.net).},

In particular, while X-ray crystallography has been a staple of structural biology for more than half a century and will continue to remain so, a major limitation of this technique has been the lack of dynamic information. Solution X-ray scattering has become an invaluable tool in structural and mechanistic studies of biological macromolecules where large conformational changes are involved. Such systems include allosteric enzymes that play key roles in directing metabolic fluxes of biochemical pathways, as well as large, assembly-line type enzymes that synthesize secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, crystallography has the potential to provide information on protein dynamics via the diffuse scattering patterns that are overlaid with Bragg diffraction. Historically, these patterns have been very difficult to interpret, but recent advances in X-ray detection have led to a renewed interest in diffuse scattering analysis as a way to probe correlated motions. Here, we will review X-ray scattering theory and highlight recent advances in scattering-based investigations of protein solutions and crystals, with a particular focus on complex enzymes.},

	abstract = {Water occupies typically 50\% of a protein crystal and thus significantly contributes to the diffraction signal in crystallography experiments. Separating its contribution from that of the protein is, however, challenging because most water molecules are not localized and are thus difficult to assign to specific density peaks. The intricateness of the protein–water interface compounds this difficulty. This information has, therefore, not often been used to study biomolecular solvation. Here, we develop a methodology to surmount in part this difficulty. More specifically, we compare the solvent structure obtained from diffraction data for which experimental phasing is available to that obtained from constrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The resulting spatial density maps show that commonly used MD water models are only partially successful at reproducing the structural features of biomolecular solvation. The radial distribution of water is captured with only slightly higher accuracy than its angular distribution, and only a fraction of the water molecules assigned with high reliability to the crystal structure is recovered. These differences are likely due to shortcomings of both the water models and the protein force fields. Despite these limitations, we manage to infer protonation states of some of the side chains utilizing MD-derived densities.},

Here we compare independently acquired pairs of high-resolution data sets of a model Michaelis complex of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), collected by separate groups at both room and cryogenic temperatures. These data sets allow us to isolate the differences between experimental procedures and between temperatures. Our analyses of multiconformer models and time-averaged ensembles suggest that cryocooling suppresses and otherwise modifies side-chain and main-chain conformational heterogeneity, quenching dynamic contact networks. Despite some idiosyncratic differences, most changes from room temperature to cryogenic temperature are conserved and likely reflect temperature-dependent solvent remodeling. Both cryogenic data sets point to additional conformations not evident in the corresponding room temperature data sets, suggesting that cryocooling does not merely trap preexisting conformational heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that crystal cryocooling consistently distorts the energy landscape of DHFR, a paragon for understanding functional protein dynamics.},

In this paper, the authors used both of these methods to identify and characterize a 'hidden' high-energy substate of human cyclophilin A, a proline isomerase. This was made possible by engineering a modified form of the enzyme incorporating a mutation at a distance from the active site that could stabilize this previously hidden conformation by inverting the equilibrium between the various substates and reducing the conformational interconversion rates and the catalytic rate. This approach should be broadly applicable to many other proteins and could lead to the reinterpretation of crystal structures determined previously.},

Competition from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and micro-electron diffraction, increased interest in functionally relevant information that may be missing or corrupted in structures determined at cryogenic temperature, and interest in time-resolved studies of the biomolecular response to chemical and optical stimuli have driven renewed interest in data collection at room temperature and, more generally, at temperatures from the protein–solvent glass transition near 200 K to ∼350 K. Fischer has recently reviewed practical methods for room-temperature data collection and analysis [Fischer (2021), Q. Rev. Biophys. 54, e1]. Here, the key advantages and physical principles of, and methods for, crystallographic data collection at noncryogenic temperatures and some factors relevant to interpreting the resulting data are discussed. For room-temperature data collection to realize its potential within the structural biology toolkit, streamlined and standardized methods for delivering crystals prepared in the home laboratory to the synchrotron and for automated handling and data collection, similar to those for cryocrystallography, should be implemented.},

The ff15ipq force field is a complete rederivation including more than 300 unique atomic charges, 900 unique torsion terms, 60 new angle parameters, and new atomic radii for polar hydrogens. The atomic charges were derived in the context of the SPC/Eb water model, which yields more-accurate rotational diffusion of proteins and enables direct calculation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation parameters from molecular dynamics simulations. The atomic radii improve the accuracy of modeling salt bridge interactions relative to contemporary fixed-charge force fields, rectifying a limitation of ff14ipq that resulted from its use of pair-specific Lennard-Jones radii. In addition, ff15ipq reproduces penta-alanine J-coupling constants exceptionally well, gives reasonable agreement with NMR relaxation rates, and maintains the expected conformational propensities of structured proteins/peptides, as well as disordered peptides—all on the microsecond (μs) time scale, which is a critical regime for drug design applications. These encouraging results demonstrate the power and robustness of our automated methods for deriving new force fields.

Force fields differ in their treatment of electrostatic interactions, including the formation of salt bridges in proteins. Here we conducted an extensive evaluation of salt bridge interactions in the latest AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS force fields, using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid analogues in explicit solvent. We focused on salt bridges between three different pairs of oppositely charged amino acids: Arg/Asp, Lys/Asp, and His(+)/Asp. Our results reveal considerable variability in the predicted KA values of the salt bridges for these force fields, as well as differences from experimental data: almost all of the force fields overestimate the strengths of the salt bridges. When amino acids are represented by side-chain analogues, the AMBER ff03 force field overestimates the KA values the least, while for complete amino acids, the AMBER ff13α force field yields the lowest KA value, most likely caused by an altered balance of side-chain/side-chain and side-chain/backbone contacts. These findings confirm the notion that the implicit incorporation of solvent polarization improves the accuracy of modeling salt bridge interactions.},

The description and understanding of their conformational properties require the development of new experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches. Here, we use nuclear spin relaxation to investigate the distribution of timescales of motions in an IDR from picoseconds to nanoseconds. Nitrogen-15 relaxation rates have been measured at five magnetic fields, ranging from 9.4 to 23.5 T (400–1000 MHz for protons). This exceptional wealth of data allowed us to map the spectral density function for the motions of backbone NH pairs in the partially disordered transcription factor Engrailed at 11 different frequencies. We introduce an approach called interpretation of motions by a projection onto an array of correlation times (IMPACT), which focuses on an array of six correlation times with intervals that are equidistant on a logarithmic scale between 21 ps and 21 ns. The distribution of motions in Engrailed varies smoothly along the protein sequence and is multimodal for most residues, with a prevalence of motions around 1 ns in the IDR. We show that IMPACT often provides better quantitative agreement with experimental data than conventional model-free or extended model-free analyses with two or three correlation times. We introduce a graphical representation that offers a convenient platform for a qualitative discussion of dynamics. Even when relaxation data are only acquired at three magnetic fields that are readily accessible, the IMPACT analysis gives a satisfactory characterization of spectral density functions, thus opening the way to a broad use of this approach.},

Using 40 pairs of NMR and X-ray crystal structures determined by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium, for proteins ranging in size from 5–22 kDa, restrained Rosetta refined structures fit better to the raw experimental data, are in better agreement with their X-ray counterparts, and have better phasing power compared to conventionally determined NMR structures. For 37 proteins for which NMR ensembles were available and which had similar structures in solution and in the crystal, all of the restrained Rosetta refined NMR structures were sufficiently accurate to be used for solving the corresponding X-ray crystal structures by molecular replacement. The protocol for restrained refinement of protein NMR structures was also compared with restrained CS-Rosetta calculations. For proteins smaller than 10 kDa, restrained CS-Rosetta, starting from extended conformations, provides slightly more accurate structures, while for proteins in the size range of 10–25 kDa the less CPU intensive restrained Rosetta refinement protocols provided equally or more accurate structures. The restrained Rosetta protocols described here can improve the accuracy of protein NMR structures and should find broad and general for studies of protein structure and function.},

	abstract = {Many proteins can be partially or completely disordered under physiological conditions. Structural characterization of these disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging, since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact relative to experiments. We find that the water models typically used in MD simulations significantly underestimate London dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that approximately corrects for these deficiencies in modeling water dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of solvated proteins using this new water model typically result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in better agreement with experiment. These results represent a significant step toward extending the range of applicability of MD simulations to include the study of (partially or fully) disordered protein states.},

	abstract = {Advances in hardware and algorithms have greatly extended the timescales accessible to molecular simulation. This article assesses whether such long timescale simulations improve our ability to calculate order parameters that describe conformational heterogeneity on ps-ns timescales or if force fields are now a limiting factor. Order parameters from experiment are compared with order parameters calculated in three different ways from simulations ranging from 10 ns to 100 μs in length. Importantly, bootstrapping is employed to assess the variability in results for each simulation length. The results of 10–100 ns timescale simulations are highly variable, possibly explaining the variation in levels of agreement between simulation and experiment in published works examining different proteins. Fortunately, microsecond timescale simulations improve both the accuracy and precision of calculated order parameters, at least so long as the full exponential fit or truncated average approximation is used instead of the common long-time limit approximation. The improved precision of these long timescale simulations allows a statistically sound comparison of a number of modern force fields, such as Amber03, Amber99sb-ILDN, and Charmm27. While there is some variation between these force fields, they generally give very similar results for sufficiently long simulations. The fact that so much simulation is required to precisely capture ps-ns timescale processes suggests that extremely extensive simulations are required for slower processes. Advanced sampling techniques could aid greatly, however, such methods will need to maintain accurate kinetics if they are to be of value for calculating dynamical properties like order parameters. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Superposition of adjacent trajectory frames yields the unique rotation axis and angle of rotation that characterizes each transformation. By proportionally scaling the rotation angles relating each consecutive pair of frames, the rotational diffusion in the RVR-MD trajectory was adjusted to correct for the elevated self-diffusion rate of TIP3P water. 15N T1 and T2 values for 32 residues in the regular secondary structures of GB3 were predicted with an rms deviation of 2.2\%, modestly larger than the estimated experimental uncertainties. Residue-specific chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) values reported from isotropic solution, liquid crystal and microcrystalline solid measurements less accurately predict GB3 relaxation than does applying a constant CSA value, potentially indicating structure-dependent correlated variations in 1H15N bond length and 15N CSA. By circumventing the quasi-static analysis of NMR order parameters often applied in MD studies, a more direct test is provided for assessing the accuracy with which molecular simulations predict protein motion in the ps–ns timeframe. Since no assumption of separability between global tumbling and internal motion is required, utility in analyzing simulations of mobility in disordered protein segments is anticipated.},

	abstract = {A general framework is presented for the interpretation of NMR relaxation data of proteins. The method, termed isotropic reorientational eigenmode dynamics (iRED), relies on a principal component analysis of the isotropically averaged covariance matrix of the lattice functions of the spin interactions responsible for spin relaxation. The covariance matrix, which is evaluated using a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, is diagonalized yielding reorientational eigenmodes and amplitudes that reveal detailed information about correlated protein dynamics. The eigenvalue distribution allows one to quantitatively assess whether overall and internal motions are statistically separable. To each eigenmode belongs a correlation time that can be adjusted to optimally reproduce experimental relaxation parameters. A key feature of the method is that it does not require separability of overall tumbling and internal motions, which makes it applicable to a wide range of systems, such as folded, partially folded, and unfolded biomolecular systems and other macromolecules in solution. The approach was applied to NMR relaxation data of ubiquitin collected at multiple magnetic fields in the native form and in the partially folded A-state using MD trajectories with lengths of 6 and 70 ns. The relaxation data of native ubiquitin are well reproduced after adjustment of the correlation times of the 10 largest eigenmodes. For this state, a high degree of separability between internal and overall motions is present as is reflected in large amplitude and collectivity gaps between internal and overall reorientational modes. In contrast, no such separability exists for the A-state. Residual overall tumbling motion involving the N-terminal β-sheet and the central helix is observed for two of the largest modes only. By adjusting the correlation times of the 10 largest modes, a high degree of consistency between the experimental relaxation data and the iRED model is reached for this highly flexible biomolecule.},

As NMR relaxation in proteins is determined by dynamics on the picosecond–nanosecond time scale, a comparison of NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations that last for less than ∼100ps is more meaningful than previous ones3–6 involving much longer time scales. We make contact between a molecular dynamics simulation8 and a 13C-NMR relaxation study9 of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (PTI) by comparing generalized order parameters (which are measures of the extent of angular motion of the bonds) extracted from the relaxation data9 with those calculated10 from a 96-ps trajectory8. We show that the theoretical order parameters indicate less motion than their experimental counterparts.

We describe a method for extracting diffusion tensors from such simulations and compare the results to experimental values extracted from NMR relaxation measurements. The simulation results accurately follow a diffusion equation, even for spherical harmonic correlation functions with l as large as 8. However, the best-fit tensors are significantly different from experiment, especially for the commonly used TIP3P water model. Simulations that are 20 to 100 times longer than the rotational tumbling times are needed for good statistics.

	abstract = {A molecular-level understanding of the function of a protein requires knowledge of both its structural and dynamic properties. NMR spectroscopy allows the measurement of generalized order parameters that provide an atomistic description of picosecond and nanosecond fluctuations in protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a complementary approach to the study of protein dynamics on similar time scales. Comparisons between NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations can be used to interpret experimental results and to improve the quality of simulation-related force fields and integration methods. However, apparent systematic discrepancies between order parameters extracted from simulations and experiments are common, particularly for elements of noncanonical secondary structure. In this paper, results from a 1.2 μs explicit solvent MD simulation of the protein ubiquitin are compared with previously determined backbone order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments [Tjandra, N.; Feller, S. E.; Pastor, R. W.; Bax, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12562−12566]. The simulation reveals fluctuations in three loop regions that occur on time scales comparable to or longer than that of the overall rotational diffusion of ubiquitin and whose effects would not be apparent in experimentally derived order parameters. A coupled analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone. Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging from the viewpoint of assessing the accuracy of long MD simulations.},

Accurate modeling of dynamics by molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations is therefore a useful approach toward the understanding of biomolecular function. NMR spin relaxation measurements provide rigorous benchmarks for assessing important aspects of MD simulations, such as the amount and time scales of conformational space sampling, which are intimately related to the underlying molecular mechanics force field. Until recently, most simulations produced trajectories that exhibited too much dynamics particularly in flexible loop regions. Recent modifications made to the backbone φ and ψ torsion angle potentials of the AMBER and CHARMM force fields indicate that these changes produce more realistic molecular dynamics behavior. To assess the consequences of these changes, we performed a series of 5−20 ns molecular dynamics trajectories of human ubiquitin using the AMBER99 and AMBER99SB force fields for different conditions and water models and compare the results with NMR experimental backbone N−H S2 order parameters. A quantitative analysis of the trajectories shows significantly improved agreement with experimental NMR data for the AMBER99SB force field as compared to AMBER99. Because NMR spin relaxation data (T1, T2, NOE) reflect the combined effects of spatial and temporal fluctuations of bond vectors, it is found that comparison of experimental and back-calculated NMR spin-relaxation data provides a more objective way of assessing the quality of the trajectory than order parameters alone. Analysis of a key mobile β-hairpin in ubiquitin demonstrates that the dynamics of mobile sites are not only reduced by the modified force field, but the extent of motional correlations between amino acids is also markedly diminished.},

	abstract = {An approach is presented to directly simulate the dynamics of methyl groups in protein side-chains, as accessible via NMR spin relaxation measurements, by all-atom MD simulations. The method, which does not rely on NMR information or any system-specific adjustable parameters, is based on calculating the time-correlation functions (TCFs) of the C–H bonds in methyl groups and explicitly takes the truncation of the TCFs due to overall tumbling of the molecule into account. Using ubiquitin as a model protein, we show (i) that an accurate description of the methyl dynamics requires reparametrization of the potential energy barriers of methyl group rotation in the AMBER ff99SB*-ILDN force field (and related parameter sets), which was done with CCSD(T) coupled cluster calculations of isolated dipeptides as reference, and (ii) that the TIP4P/2005 solvation model yields overall tumbling correlation times that are in close agreement with experimental data. The methyl axis squared order parameters Saxis2 and associated correlation times τf, obtained within the Lipari–Szabo formalism, are in good agreement with the values derived from NMR deuterium relaxation experiments. Importantly, the relaxation rates and spectral densities derived from MD and NMR agree as well, enabling a direct comparison without assumptions inherent to simplified motional models.},

	abstract = {Two modifications to the commonly used protocols for calculating NMR structures are developed, relating to the treatment of NOE constraints involving groups of equivalent protons or nonstereoassigned diastereotopic protons. Firstly, a modified method is investigated for correcting for multiplicity, which is applicable whenever all NOE intensities are calibrated as a single set and categorised in broad intensity ranges. Secondly, a new set of values for ‘pseudoatom corrections’ is proposed for use with calculations employing ‘centre-averaging’. The effect of these protocols on structure calculations is demonstrated using two proteins, one of which is well defined by the NOE data, the other less so. It is shown that failure to correct for multiplicity when using ‘r-6 averaging’ results in overly precise structures, higher NOE energies and deviations from geometric ideality, while failure to correct for multiplicity when using ‘r-6 summation’ can cause an avoidable degradation of precision if the NOE data are sparse. Conversely, when multiplicities are treated correctly, r-6 averaging, r-6 summation and centre averaging all give closely comparable results when the structure is well defined by the data. When the NOE data contain less information, r-6 averaging or r-6 summation offer a significant advantage over centre averaging, both in terms of precision and in terms of the proportion of calculations that converge on a consisten result.},

Here, we apply classical molecular dynamics simulations to interpret the conformational fluctuations and rotational tumbling of proteins with arbitrarily anisotropic shape. The direct calculation of spin relaxation times from simulation data did not reproduce the experimental data. This was successfully corrected by scaling the overall rotational diffusion coefficients around the protein inertia axes with a constant factor. The achieved good agreement with experiments allowed the interpretation of the internal and overall dynamics of proteins with significantly anisotropic shape. The overall rotational diffusion was found to be Brownian, having only a short subdiffusive region below 0.12 ns. The presented methodology can be applied to interpret rotational dynamics and conformation fluctuations of proteins with arbitrary anisotropic shape. However, a water model with more realistic dynamical properties is probably required for intrinsically disordered proteins.},

	abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent−solvent, solvent−solute, and solute−solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein φ, χ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

To address these issues, we make the simplest possible change, by modifying the short-range protein–water pair interactions, and leaving all the water–water and protein–protein parameters unchanged. We find that a modest strengthening of protein–water interactions is sufficient to recover the correct dimensions of intrinsically disordered or unfolded proteins, as determined by direct comparison with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) data. The modification also results in more realistic protein-protein affinities, and average solvation free energies of model compounds which are more consistent with experiment. Most importantly, we show that this scaling is small enough not to affect adversely the stability of the folded state, with only a modest effect on the stability of model peptides forming α-helix and β-sheet structures. The proposed adjustment opens the way to more accurate atomistic simulations of proteins, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins, protein–protein association, and crowded cellular environments.},

To that end, we performed equilibrium simulations of a fast-folding variant of the villin headpiece using four different force fields. In each simulation, we observed a large number of transitions between the unfolded and folded states, and in all four cases, both the rate of folding and the structure of the native state were in good agreement with experiments. We found, however, that the folding mechanism and the properties of the unfolded state depend substantially on the choice of force field. We thus conclude that although it is important to match a single, experimentally determined structure and folding rate, this does not ensure that a given simulation will provide a unique and correct description of the full free-energy surface and the mechanism of folding.},

Although early force field development was limited by the lack of direct comparisons between simulation and experiment, recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated direct calculation of NMR observables from protein simulations. Here, we quantitatively evaluate 11 recent molecular dynamics force fields in combination with 5 solvent models against a suite of 524 chemical shift and J coupling (3JHNHα, 3JHNCβ, 3JHαC′, 3JHNC′, and 3JHαN) measurements on dipeptides, tripeptides, tetra-alanine, and ubiquitin. Of the force fields examined (ff96, ff99, ff03, ff03*, ff03w, ff99sb*, ff99sb-ildn, ff99sb-ildn-phi, ff99sb-ildn-NMR, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA), two force fields (ff99sb-ildn-phi, ff99sb-ildn-NMR) combining recent side chain and backbone torsion modifications achieved high accuracy in our benchmark. For the two optimal force fields, the calculation error is comparable to the uncertainty in the experimental comparison. This observation suggests that extracting additional force field improvements from NMR data may require increased accuracy in J coupling and chemical shift prediction. To further investigate the limitations of current force fields, we also consider conformational populations of dipeptides, which were recently estimated using vibrational spectroscopy.},

To investigate this apparent contradiction, with its ramifications for the assessment of molecular force fields and the structure of unfolded proteins, we performed extensive simulations of Ala5 in water (∼5μs total time), using twelve different force fields and three different peptide terminal groups. Using either empirical or density-functional-based Karplus relations for the J-couplings, we find that most current force fields do overpopulate the α-region, with quantitative results depending on the choice of Karplus relation and on the peptide termini. Even after reweighting to match experiment, we find that Ala5 retains significant α- and β-populations. In fact, several force fields match the experimental data well before reweighting and have a significant helical population. We conclude that radical changes to the best current force fields are not necessary, based on the NMR data. Nevertheless, experiments on short peptides open the way toward the systematic improvement of current simulation models.},

Combining the accuracy of the measured scalar coupling constants and the atomistic detail of the all-atom MD simulations with explicit solvent, the thermal populations of the peptide conformational states are determined with an uncertainty of {\textless}5 \%. Trialanine samples mainly (∼90\%) a poly-l-proline II helix-like structure, some (∼10\%) β extended structure, but no αR helical conformations. No significant change in the distribution of conformers is observed with increasing chain length (Ala3 to Ala7). Trivaline samples all three major conformations significantly. Tryglycine samples the four corner regions of the Ramachandran space and exists in a slow conformational equilibrium between the cis and trans conformation of peptide bonds. The backbone angle distribution was also studied for the segment Ala3 surrounded by either three or eight amino acids on both N- and C-termini from a sequence derived from the protein hen egg white lysozyme. While the conformational distribution of the central three alanine residues in the 9mer is similar to that for the small peptides Ala3-Ala7, major differences are found for the 19mer, which significantly (30−40\%) samples αR helical stuctures.},

	abstract = {A study is presented of the structural dependencies for scalar J-coupling and the amide donor 1H chemical shifts in the hydrogen bonding regions of proteins. An analysis of the interactions between the donor hydrogen and acceptor oxygen orbitals in an N−H···OC moiety suggests that there are three major structural factors for 15N−13C coupling across hydrogen bonds: (1) the H···O‘ internuclear separation rHO‘, (2) the H···O‘C‘ angle θ2, and (3) indirect contributions involving the oxygen loan pair electrons should lead to a dependence on the H···O‘C‘−N‘ dihedral angle ρ. Density functional theory (DFT) and finite perturbation theory (FPT) were used to obtain the Fermi contact (FC) contributions to interresidue coupling in formamide dimers with systematic variation of these structural parameters. The computed h3JNC‘ exhibit good correlations with cos2 θ2 combined with an exponential dependence on rHO‘. The correlation is further improved by including a dependence on the dihedral angle ρ. For each of the 34 H-bonds having observable interresidue coupling in the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G, a formamide dimer was generated from the crystallographic structure with energy-optimized donor H-atom positions. The computed coupling constants are in reasonable agreement with the experimental, and there are excellent correlations with the simple equations involving θ2 and rHO if α-helix and β-sheet regions are treated separately. This dichotomy is removed by introducing the dependence on the dihedral angle ρ. Justification for the use of formamide dimers is provided by almost identical interresidue coupling contants for larger sequences extracted from the X-ray structure. The amide donor 1H chemical shifts, which were based on DFT and GIAO (gauge including atomic orbital) methods, are in poorer agreement with the experimental data but exhibit excellent correlation with rHO‘, θ2, and ρ.},

	abstract = {Side-chain dynamics in proteins can be characterized by the NMR measurement of 13C and 2H relaxation rates. Evaluation of the corresponding spectral densities limits the slowest motions that can be studied quantitatively to the time scale on which the overall molecular tumbling takes place. A different measure for the degree of side-chain order about the Cα−Cβ bond (χ1 angle) can be derived from 3JC‘-Cγ and 3JN-Cγ couplings. These couplings can be measured at high accuracy, in particular for Thr, Ile, and Val residues. In conjunction with the known backbone structures of ubiquitin and the third IgG-binding domain of protein G, and an extensive set of 13C−1H side-chain dipolar coupling measurements in oriented media, these 3J couplings were used to parametrize empirical Karplus relationships for 3JC‘-Cγ and 3JN-Cγ. These Karplus curves agree well with results from DFT calculations, including an unusual phase shift, which causes the maximum 3JCC and 3JCN couplings to occur for dihedral angles slightly smaller than 180°, particularly noticeable in Thr residues. The new Karplus curves permit determination of rotamer populations for the χ1 torsion angles. Similar rotamer populations can be derived from side-chain dipolar couplings. Conversion of these rotamer populations into generalized order parameters, SJ2 and SD2, provides a view of side-chain dynamics that is complementary to that obtained from 13C and 2H relaxation. On average, results agree well with literature values for 2H-relaxation-derived Srel2 values in ubiquitin and HIV protease, but also identify a fraction of residues for which SJ,D2 {\textless} Srel2. This indicates that some of the rotameric averaging occurs on a time scale too slow to be observable in traditional relaxation measurements.},

	abstract = {Recently proposed self-consistent 3J coupling analysis (Schmidt, J. M.; Blümel, M.; Löhr, F.; Rüterjans, H. J. Biomol. NMR 1999, 14, 1−12) has been carried out to calibrate Karplus parameters constituting the empirical dependence of 3J coupling constants on the χ1 dihedral angle in amino acid side chains. The procedure involves simultaneous least-squares optimization of six sets of three Karplus coefficients related to all six 3J coupling types accessible in 15N,13C-labeled proteins. A simple concept of fundamental and incremental component couplings is proposed to account for substituent effects, eventually yielding amino acid topology-specific Karplus parameters. The method is exemplified with recombinant Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin (147 amino acids, 16 kDa) with reference to a total of 749 experimental 3JHα,Hβ, 3JN‘,Hβ, 3JC‘,Hβ, 3JHα,Cγ, 3JN‘,Cγ, and 3JC‘,Cγ coupling constants. Unlike other parametrizations, the present method does not make reference to X-ray coordinates, so that the Karplus coefficients obtained are not influenced by differences between solution and crystal states. Cross validation using X-ray torsion angles demonstrates the improvement relative to previous parametrizations. The Karplus coefficients derived are applicable to other proteins, too. Parameter refinement also yields a series of χ1 torsion angles, providing valuable constraints for protein structure determination, as well as optional parameters of local angular mobility in the contexts of Gaussian random fluctuation or a three-site jump model. The procedure permits automatic stereospecific assignments of Hβ and Cγ chemical shifts. The majority of the flavodoxin side-chain conformations agrees with high-resolution X-ray structures of the protein. Marked deviations between NMR and X-ray datasets are attributed to different rotameric states due to crystal-packing effects and to conformational equilibria between multiple χ1 rotamers.},

Here, we reinvestigated the connection between 1JCαHα values and protein backbone dihedral angles.

In intrinsically disordered proteins, slow transverse relaxation permits measurement of 3JC′C′ and 3JHNH couplings at very high precision, and impact of factors other than the intervening torsion angle on 3J will be minimal, making these couplings exceptionally valuable structural reporters.

J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 10380–10388). Interestingly, the calculated values based on an NMR structure are more accurate than those based on a high-resolution X-ray strucure because the NMR structure was refined using a large number of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) whereas the hydrogen atoms were added into the X-ray structure in idealized positions, confirming that the postioning of the hydrogen atoms relative to the backbone atoms is important to the accuracy of J coupling constant prediction. By comparing three Karplus equations, our results have demonstrated that hydrogen bonding, substituent and electrostatic effects could have significant impacts on vicinal J couplings even though they depend mostly on the intervening dihedral angles. The root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the calculated 3J(HN,Hα), 3J(HN,Cβ), 3J(HN,C′) values based on the NMR structure are 0.52, 0.25, and 0.35 Hz, respectively, after taking the dynamic effect into consideration.

	abstract = {The experimental determination of scalar three-bond coupling constants represents a powerful method to probe both the structure and dynamics of proteins. The detailed structural interpretation of such coupling constants is usually based on Karplus relationships, which allow the measured couplings to be related to the torsion angles of the molecules. As the measured couplings are sensitive to thermal fluctuations, the parameters in the Karplus relationships are better derived from ensembles representing the distributions of dihedral angles present in solution, rather than from single conformations. We present a method to derive such parameters that uses ensembles of conformations determined through dynamic-ensemble refinement – a method that provides structural ensembles that simultaneously represent both the structure and the associated dynamics of a protein.},

	abstract = {Vicinal scalar J-coupling constants in polypeptides are analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. The couplings studied are the six 3J-coupling constants that involve the φ backbone torsion angle, 3J(HN−Hα), 3J(HN−Cβ), 3J(HN−C‘), 3J(C‘−Hα), 3J(C‘−Cβ), and 3J(C‘−C‘), and two 3J-coupling constants, 3J(Hα−N) and 3J(N−N), that involve the ψ backbone torsion angle. The dependence of these couplings on their main torsion angle as well as other degrees of freedom are investigated by computations performed on two different versions of the alanine dipeptide, Ala-Ala-NH2 and Ace-Ala-NMe, with sets of coordinates obtained by different structure optimization schemes and from snapshots extracted from a MD trajectory of ubiquitin. In this way, assumptions that underlie the widely used Karplus relationships can be independently tested. Static Karplus curves, which are fitted to the computed couplings as a function of the φ-torsion angle, are generally in good agreement with empirical Karplus curves reported for several proteins if substantial motional averaging effects are taken into account. For ubiquitin, the average φ-angle fluctuation amplitudes are ±24°, which is somewhat larger than what has been found from NMR relaxation measurements and MD simulations, presumably because these latter techniques predominantly reflect motions on the ns and sub-ns time-scale range. Systematic differences in the backbone φ angles between the solution-state and the crystalline structure are found to play a minor role. The two J couplings involving the ψ angle are sensitive not only to their main torsion angle, but also to other degrees of freedom, which may complicate their interpretation. The emergence of DFT as a quantitative tool for the interpretation of scalar J-coupling constants enhances the power of J-coupling analysis as a unique probe of structural dynamics of biomolecules.},

	abstract = {The backbone dihedral angle φ in polypeptides is characterized by four different J couplings:  3JHNHα, 3JHNC‘, 3JHNCβ, and 3JHαC‘. E.COSY and quantitative J correlation techniques have been used to measure these couplings in the protein human ubiquitin, uniformly enriched in 13C and 15N. Assuming that the dihedral backbone angles in solution are identical to those in the X-ray structure of this protein and that HN is located in the C‘−N−Cα plane, Karplus relations for 3JHNHα, 3JHαC‘, and 3JHNCβ, have been reparametrized. The root-mean-square (rms) difference between measured values of 3JHNHα, 3JHαC‘, 3JHNCβ, and 3JHNC‘ and their corresponding Karplus curves are 0.53, 0.25, 0.24, and 0.36 Hz, respectively, whereas the precision of these measurements is considerably better. For any given residue, the differences between the four measured J couplings and values predicted by their Karplus curves on the basis of the X-ray structure-derived φ angle are highly correlated with one another. On average, a root-mean-square change of 5.7° in the X-ray derived φ angles is needed to obtain optimal agreement with all four measured J couplings. There is no clear correlation between the φ angle correction needed and the out-of-plane position of the amide proton predicted by ab initio calculations. The small differences in φ angles therefore presumably result from small uncertainties in the atomic positions of the 1.8 Å X-ray structure. However, they may also be caused by genuine differences between the structure of the protein in solution and in the crystalline state or contain a contribution resulting from deviations from the assumption that the HN−N−Cα−Hα dihedral angle equals φ − 60°.},

	abstract = {3JHN,Hα, 3JHN,Cβ, and 3JHN,C‘ couplings, all related to the backbone torsion angle φ, were measured for the third immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G, or GB3. Measurements were carried out using both previously published methods and novel sequences based on the multiple-quantum principle, which limit attenuation of experimental couplings caused by finite lifetimes of the spin states of passive spins. High reproducibility between the multiple-quantum and conventional approaches confirms the accuracy of the measurements. With few exceptions, close agreement between 3JHN,Hα, 3JHN,Cβ, and 3JHN,C‘ and values predicted by their respective Karplus equations is observed. For the three types of couplings, up to 20\% better agreement is obtained when fitting the experimental couplings to a dynamic ensemble NMR structure, which has a φ angle root-mean-square spread of 9 ± 4° and was previously calculated on the basis of a very extensive set of residual dipolar couplings, than for any single static NMR structure. Fits of 3J couplings to a 1.1-Å X-ray structure, with hydrogens added in idealized positions, are 40−90\% worse. Approximately half of the improvement when fitting to the NMR structures relates to the amide proton deviating from its idealized, in-peptide-plane position, indicating that the positioning of hydrogens relative to the backbone atoms is one of the factors limiting the accuracy at which the backbone torsion angle φ can be extracted from 3J couplings. Introducing an additional, residue-specific variable for the amplitude of φ angle fluctuations does not yield a statistically significant improvement when fitting to a set of dynamic Karplus curves, pointing to a homogeneous behavior of these amplitudes.},

	abstract = {Importance of disordered protein regions is increasingly recognized in biology, but their characterization remains challenging due to the lack of suitable experimental and theoretical methods. NMR experiments can detect multiple timescale dynamics and structural details of disordered protein regions, but their detailed interpretation is often difficult. Here we combine protein backbone 15N spin relaxation data with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to detect not only heterogeneous dynamics of large partially disordered proteins but also their conformational ensembles. We observed that the rotational dynamics of folded regions in partially disordered proteins is dominated by similar rigid body rotation as in globular proteins, thereby being largely independent of flexible disordered linkers. Disordered regions, on the other hand, exhibit complex rotational motions with multiple timescales below ∼30 ns which are difficult to detect from experimental data alone, but can be captured by MD simulations. Combining MD simulations and backbone 15N spin relaxation data, measured applying segmental isotopic labeling with salt-inducible split intein, we resolved the conformational ensemble and dynamics of partially disordered periplasmic domain of TonB protein from Helicobacter pylori containing 250 residues. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, it was applied also to the partially disordered region of chicken Engrailed 2. Our results pave the way in understanding how TonB transfers energy from inner membrane to the outer membrane receptors in Gram-negative bacteria, as well as the function of other proteins with disordered domains.},

Here, we show that enhancing the sampling using Hamiltonian replica-exchange MD (HREMD) led to unbiased and accurate ensembles, reproducing small-angle scattering and NMR chemical shift experiments, for three IDPs of varying sequence properties using two recently optimized force fields, indicating the general applicability of HREMD for IDPs. We further demonstrate that, unlike HREMD, standard MD can reproduce experimental NMR chemical shifts, but not small-angle scattering data, suggesting chemical shifts are insufficient for testing the validity of IDP ensembles. Surprisingly, we reveal that despite differences in their sequence, the inter-chain statistics of all three IDPs are similar for short contour lengths ({\textless} 10 residues). The results suggest that the major hurdle of generating an accurate unbiased ensemble for IDPs has now been largely overcome.},

For instance the amyloid-β monomer, according to NMR chemical shifts, adopts a predominately random coil structure in aqueous solution (with {\textless}3\% α-helical content). Molecular dynamics simulations, on the other hand, suggest that α-helical content can be significant (10–25\%).

With the advent of selective labeling schemes, methyl groups are particularly interesting in the context of chemical shift based protein structure determination, an approach that to date has exploited primarily the mapping between protein structures and backbone chemical shifts. In order to extend the scope of chemical shifts for structure determination, we present here the CH3Shift method of performing structure-based predictions of methyl chemical shifts. The terms considered in the predictions take account of ring current, magnetic anisotropy, electric field, rotameric type, and dihedral angle effects, which are considered in conjunction with polynomial functions of interatomic distances. We show that the CH3Shift method achieves an accuracy in the predictions that ranges from 0.133 to 0.198 ppm for 1H chemical shifts for Ala, Thr, Val, Leu and Ile methyl groups. We illustrate the use of the method by assessing the accuracy of side-chain structures in structural ensembles representing the dynamics of proteins.},

Both isotropic shifts and chemical shift tensors are readily accessible from NMR experiments but their quantum mechanical calculations remain challenging. In this work, we report and compare accurately measured and calculated 15NH and 13Cα chemical shift tensors in proteins, using the microcrystalline agglutinin from Oscillatoria agardhii (OAA). Experimental 13Cα and 15NH chemical tensors were obtained by solid-state NMR spectroscopy, employing tailored recoupling sequences, and for their quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations different sets of functionals were evaluated. We show that 13Cα chemical shift tensors are primarily determined by backbone dihedral angles and dynamics, while 15NH tensors mainly depend on local electrostatic contributions from solvation and hydrogen bonding. In addition, the influence of including crystallographic waters, the molecular mechanics geometry optimization protocol, and the level of theory on the accuracy of the calculated chemical shift tensors is discussed. Specifically, the power of QM/MM calculations in accurately predicting the unusually upfield shifted 1HN G26 and G93 resonances is highlighted. Our integrated approach is expected to benefit structure refinement of proteins and protein assemblies.},

	abstract = {We have developed an efficient protocol using our two-layer Molecules-in-Molecules (MIM2) fragmentation-based quantum chemical method for the prediction of NMR chemical shifts of large biomolecules. To investigate the performance of our fragmentation approach and demonstrate its applicability, MIM-NMR calculations are first calibrated on a test set of six proteins. The MIM2-NMR method yields a mean absolute deviation (MAD) from unfragmented full molecule calculations of 0.01 ppm for 1H and 0.06 ppm for 13C chemical shifts. Thus, the errors from fragmentation are only about 3\% of our target accuracy of ∼0.3 ppm for 1H and 2–3 ppm for 13C chemical shifts. To compare with experimental chemical shifts, a standard protocol is first derived using two smaller proteins 2LHY (176 atoms) and 2LI1 (146 atoms) for obtaining an appropriate protein structure for NMR chemical shift calculations. The effect of the solvent environment on the calculated NMR chemical shifts is incorporated through implicit, explicit, or explicit–implicit solvation models. The expensive first solvation shell calculations are replaced by a micro-solvation model in which only the immediate interaction between the protein and the explicit solvation environment is considered. A single explicit water molecule for each amine and amide proton is found to be sufficient to yield accurate results for 1H chemical shifts. The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts calculated using our protocol give excellent agreement with experiments for two larger proteins, 2MC5 (the helical part with 265 atoms) and 3UMK (33 residue slice with 547 atoms). Overall, our target accuracy of ∼0.3 ppm for 1H and ∼2–3 ppm for 13C has been achieved for the larger proteins. The proposed MIM-NMR method is accurate and computationally cost-effective and should be applicable to study a wide range of large proteins.},

Despite the simplicity of empirical chemical shift prediction programs, the agreement with experimental results is rather good, underlining their usefulness. However, we show in our present work that they are highly insensitive to structural changes, which renders their use for validating predicted structures questionable. In contrast, quantum chemical methods show the expected high sensitivity to structural and electronic changes. This appears to be independent of the quantum chemical approach or the inclusion of solvent effects. For the latter, explicit solvent simulations with increasing number of snapshots were performed for two conformers of an eight amino acid sequence. In conclusion, the empirical approaches neither provide the expected magnitude nor the patterns of NMR chemical shifts determined by the clearly more costly ab initio methods upon structural changes. This restricts the use of empirical prediction programs in studies where peptide and protein structures are utilized for the NMR chemical shift evaluation such as in NMR refinement processes, structural model verifications, or calculations of NMR nuclear spin relaxation rates.},

Proteins2011, 79, 2189–2202]. The systematic investigation performed here on the influences of the level of theory, basis set size, inclusion or exclusion of an implicit solvent model, and the use of partial charges to describe additional parts of the macromolecule on the accuracy of NMR chemical shifts demonstrates that using a valence triple-ζ basis set leads to large improvement compared to the results given in the previous publication. Additionally, moving from the B3LYP to the mPW1PW91 density functional and including partial charges and implicit solvents gave the best results with mean absolute errors of 0.44 ppm for hydrogen atoms excluding HN atoms and between 1.53 and 3.44 ppm for carbon atoms depending on the size and also on the accuracy of the protein structure. Polar hydrogen and nitrogen atoms are more difficult to predict. For the first, explicit hydrogen bonds to the solvents need to be included and, for the latter, going beyond DFT to post-Hartree–Fock methods like MP2 is probably required. Even if empirical methods like SHIFTX+ show similar performance, our calculations give for the first time very reliable chemical shifts that can also be used for complexes of proteins with small-molecule ligands or DNA/RNA. Therefore, taking advantage of its ab initio nature, our approach opens new fields of application that would otherwise be largely inaccessible due to insufficient availability of data for empirical parametrization.},

	abstract = {Salt bridges occur frequently in proteins, providing conformational specificity and contributing to molecular recognition and catalysis. We present a comprehensive analysis of these interactions in protein structures by surveying a large database of protein structures. Salt bridges between Asp or Glu and His, Arg, or Lys display extremely well-defined geometric preferences. Several previously observed preferences are confirmed, and others that were previously unrecognized are discovered. Salt bridges are explored for their preferences for different separations in sequence and in space, geometric preferences within proteins and at protein–protein interfaces, co-operativity in networked salt bridges, inclusion within metal-binding sites, preference for acidic electrons, apparent conformational side chain entropy reduction on formation, and degree of burial. Salt bridges occur far more frequently between residues at close than distant sequence separations, but, at close distances, there remain strong preferences for salt bridges at specific separations. Specific types of complex salt bridges, involving three or more members, are also discovered. As we observe a strong relationship between the propensity to form a salt bridge and the placement of salt-bridging residues in protein sequences, we discuss the role that salt bridges might play in kinetically influencing protein folding and thermodynamically stabilizing the native conformation. We also develop a quantitative method to select appropriate crystal structure resolution and B-factor cutoffs.

Using extensive cross-validation we show that five different types of independent experimental parameters are predicted more accurately by selected ensembles than by statistical coil descriptions. The improvement increases in regions whose local sampling deviates from statistical coil, validating the derived conformational description.

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are predicted to represent a significant fraction of the human genome, and the development of meaningful molecular descriptions of these proteins remains a key challenge for contemporary structural biology. In order to describe the conformational behavior of IDPs, a molecular representation of the disordered state based on diverse sources of structural data that often exhibit complex and very different averaging behavior is required. In this study, we propose a combination of paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) to define both long-range and local structural features of IDPs in solution. We demonstrate that ASTEROIDS, an ensemble selection algorithm, faithfully reproduces intramolecular contacts, even in the presence of highly diffuse, ill-defined target interactions. We also show that explicit modeling of spin-label mobility significantly improves the reproduction of experimental PRE data, even in the case of highly disordered proteins. Prediction of the effects of transient long-range contacts on RDC profiles reveals that weak intramolecular interactions can induce a severe distortion of the profiles that compromises the description of local conformational sampling if it is not correctly taken into account. We have developed a solution to this problem that involves efficiently combining RDC and PRE data to simultaneously determine long-range and local structure in highly flexible proteins. This combined analysis is shown to be essential for the accurate interpretation of experimental data from α-synuclein, an important IDP involved in human neurodegenerative disease, confirming the presence of long-range order between distant regions in the protein.},

NMR spectroscopy is unique among biophysical approaches in its ability to provide a broad range of atomic and higher-level information relevant to the structural, dynamic, and chemical properties of biological macromolecules, as well as report on metabolite and natural product concentrations in complex mixtures and their chemical structures. BMRB became a core member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) in 2007, and the BMRB archive is now a core archive of the wwPDB. Currently, about 10\% of the structures deposited into the PDB archive are based on NMR spectroscopy. BMRB stores experimental and derived data from biomolecular NMR studies. Newer BMRB biopolymer depositions are divided about evenly between those associated with structure determinations (atomic coordinates and supporting information archived in the PDB) and those reporting experimental information on molecular dynamics, conformational transitions, ligand binding, assigned chemical shifts, or other results from NMR spectroscopy. BMRB also provides resources for NMR studies of metabolites and other small molecules that are often macromolecular ligands and/or nonstandard residues. This chapter is directed to the structural biology community rather than the metabolomics and natural products community. Our goal is to describe various BMRB services offered to structural biology researchers and how they can be accessed and utilized. These services can be classified into four main groups: (1) data deposition, (2) data retrieval, (3) data analysis, and (4) services for NMR spectroscopists and software developers. The chapter also describes the NMR-STAR data format used by BMRB and the tools provided to facilitate its use. For programmers, BMRB offers an application programming interface (API) and libraries in the Python and R languages that enable users to develop their own BMRB-based tools for data analysis, visualization, and manipulation of NMR-STAR formatted files. BMRB also provides users with direct access tools through the NMRbox platform.},

	abstract = {Random coil chemical shifts are commonly used to detect secondary structure elements in proteins in chemical shift index calculations. While this technique is very reliable for folded proteins, application to unfolded proteins reveals significant deviations from measured random coil shifts for certain nuclei. While some of these deviations can be ascribed to residual structure in the unfolded protein, others are clearly caused by local sequence effects. In particular, the amide nitrogen, amide proton, and carbonyl carbon chemical shifts are highly sensitive to the local amino acid sequence. We present a detailed, quantitative analysis of the effect of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids on the random coil shifts of 15NH, 1HN, and 13CO resonances of neighboring residues, utilizing complete resonance assignments for a set of five-residue peptides Ac-G-G-X-G-G-NH2. The work includes a validation of the concepts used to derive sequence-dependent correction factors for random coil chemical shifts, and a comprehensive tabulation of sequence-dependent correction factors that can be applied for amino acids up to two residues from a given position. This new set of correction factors will have important applications to folded proteins as well as to short, unstructured peptides and unfolded proteins.},

	abstract = {Random coil chemical shifts are necessary for secondary chemical shift analysis, which is the main NMR method for identification of secondary structure in proteins. One of the largest challenges in the determination of random coil chemical shifts is accounting for the effect of neighboring residues. The contributions from the neighboring residues are typically removed by using neighbor correction factors determined based on each residue’s effect on glycine chemical shifts. Due to its unusual conformational freedom, glycine may be particularly unrepresentative for the remaining residue types. In this study, we use random coil peptides containing glutamine instead of glycine to determine the random coil chemical shifts and the neighbor correction factors. The resulting correction factors correlate to changes in the populations of the major wells in the Ramachandran plot, which demonstrates that changes in the conformational ensemble are an important source of neighbor effects in disordered proteins. Glutamine derived random coil chemical shifts and correction factors modestly improve our ability to predict 13C chemical shifts of intrinsically disordered proteins compared to existing datasets, and may thus improve the identification of small populations of transient structure in disordered proteins.},

	abstract = {Although intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are widespread in nature and play diverse and important roles in biology, they have to date been little characterized structurally. Auspiciously, intensified efforts using NMR spectroscopy have started to uncover the breadth of their conformational landscape. In particular, polypeptide backbone chemical shifts are emerging as powerful descriptors of local dynamic deviations from the “random coil” state toward canonical types of secondary structure. These digressions, in turn, can be connected to functional or dysfunctional protein states, for example, in adaptive molecular recognition and protein aggregation. Here we describe a first inventory of IDP backbone 15N, 1HN, 1Hα, 13CO, 13Cβ, and 13Cα chemical shifts using data obtained for a set of 14 proteins of unrelated sequence and function. Singular value decomposition was used to parametrize this database of 6903 measured shifts collectively in terms of 20 amino acid-specific random coil chemical shifts and 40 sequence-dependent left- and right-neighbor correction factors, affording the ncIDP library. For natively unfolded proteins, random coil backbone chemical shifts computed from the primary sequence displayed root-mean-square deviations of 0.65, 0.14, 0.12, 0.50, 0.36, and 0.41 ppm from the experimentally measured values for the 15N, 1HN, 1Hα, 13CO, 13Cβ, and 13Cα chemical shifts, respectively. The ncIDP prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that obtained with libraries for small peptides or “coil” regions of folded proteins.},

In order to further our previous descriptions of the Uexch state, we have developed a protocol for calculating ensembles of structures, based on experimental spectroscopic data, which broadly represent the unfolded state. A large number of unfolding trajectories were generated, starting from the folded state structure of the protein, in order to provide a reasonable sampling of the conformational space accessible to this sequence. Unfolded state ensembles have been “calculated” using a newly developed program ENSEMBLE, which optimizes the population weights assigned to each structure based on experimental properties of the Uexch state. Pseudo-energy terms for nuclear Overhauser effects, J-coupling constants, 13C chemical shifts, translational diffusion coefficients and tryptophan ring burial based on NMR and fluorescence data have been implemented. The population weight assignment procedure was performed for different starting ensembles. Small numbers of structures ({\textless}60) dominate the final ensembles compared to the total number in the starting ensembles, suggesting that the drkN SH3 domain Uexch state can be described by a limited number of lower-energy conformations. The calculated Uexch state ensembles are much more compact than a “random coil” chain, with significant native-like residual structure observed. In particular, a sizable population of conformers having the n-src loop and distal β-hairpin structures exist in the calculated Uexch state ensembles, and Trp36 is involved in a large number of interactions, both native and non-native.},

In particular, back-calculated chemical shifts provide a sensitive probe of the populations of residual secondary structure elements and helix capping interactions, while spin-relaxation calculations are sensitive to a combination of dynamic and structural factors. Back-calculated chemical shift and spin-relaxation data can be used to evaluate the populations of specific interactions in disordered states and identify regions of the phase space that are inconsistent with experimental measurements. The structural interactions that favor and disfavor helical conformations in the disordered basic region of the GCN4 bZip domain were analyzed in order to assess the implications of the structure and dynamics of the apo form for the DNA binding mechanism.

MD-averaged chemical shift predictions generally improve agreement with experimental values when compared to predictions made from static X-ray structures. Improved chemical shift predictions result from population-weighted sampling of multiple conformational states and from sampling smaller fluctuations within conformational basins. Improved chemical shift predictions also result from discrete changes to conformations observed in X-ray structures, which may result from crystal contacts, and are not always reflective of conformational dynamics in solution. Chemical shifts are sensitive reporters of fluctuations in backbone and side chain torsional angles, and averaged 1H chemical shifts are particularly sensitive reporters of fluctuations in aromatic ring positions and geometries of hydrogen bonds. In addition, poor predictions of MD-averaged chemical shifts can identify spurious conformations and motions observed in MD simulations that may result from force field deficiencies or insufficient sampling and can also suggest subsets of conformational space that are more consistent with experimental data. These results suggest that the analysis of dynamically averaged NMR chemical shifts from MD simulations can serve as a powerful approach for characterizing protein motions in atomistic detail.},

Significant improvement in the predicted chemical shift data coincides with those regions of the protein that exhibit backbone dynamics on longer time scales. Interestingly, the optimal acceleration level for reproduction of the chemical shift data has previously been shown to best reproduce the experimental residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data for this system, as both chemical shift data and RDCs report on an ensemble and time average in the millisecond range.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that protein structures can be determined from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts using a molecular fragment replacement strategy. In these approaches, structural motifs are selected from existing protein structures on the basis of chemical shift and sequence homology and assembled to generate new structures. Here, we demonstrate that it is also possible to determine structures of proteins by directly incorporating experimental NMR chemical shifts as structural restraints in conformational searches, without the use of structural homology and molecular fragment replacement. In this approach, a protein is folded from an extended conformation to its native state using a simulated annealing procedure that minimizes an energy function that combines a standard force field with a term that penalizes the differences between experimental and calculated chemical shifts. We provide an initial demonstration of this procedure by determining the structure of two small proteins, with α and β folds, respectively.},

We show that this strategy enables the folding of a set of proteins with representative topologies starting from partially denatured initial conformations without the use of additional experimental information. This method also enables the straightforward combination of chemical shifts with other standard NMR restraints, including those derived from NOE, J-coupling, and residual dipolar coupling measurements. We illustrate this aspect by calculating the structure of a transiently populated excited state conformation from chemical shift and residual dipolar coupling data measured by relaxation dispersion NMR experiments.},

A robust protocol is described that exploits this relation for de novo protein structure generation, using as input experimental parameters the 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, 1Hα and 1HN NMR chemical shifts. These shifts are generally available at the early stage of the traditional NMR structure determination process, before the collection and analysis of structural restraints. The chemical shift based structure determination protocol uses an empirically optimized procedure to select protein fragments from the Protein Data Bank, in conjunction with the standard ROSETTA Monte Carlo assembly and relaxation methods. Evaluation of 16 proteins, varying in size from 56 to 129 residues, yielded full-atom models that have 0.7–1.8 Å root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms relative to the experimentally determined x-ray or NMR structures. The strategy also has been successfully applied in a blind manner to nine protein targets with molecular masses up to 15.4 kDa, whose conventional NMR structure determination was conducted in parallel by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium. This protocol potentially provides a new direction for high-throughput NMR structure determination.},

Unlike conventional NMR methods, CS23D requires no NOE and/or J-coupling data to perform its calculations. CS23D accepts chemical shift files in either SHIFTY or BMRB formats, and produces a set of PDB coordinates for the protein in about 10–15 min. CS23D uses a pipeline of several preexisting programs or servers to calculate the actual protein structure. Depending on the sequence similarity (or lack thereof) CS23D uses either (i) maximal subfragment assembly (a form of homology modeling), (ii) chemical shift threading or (iii) shift-aided de novo structure prediction (via Rosetta) followed by chemical shift refinement to generate and/or refine protein coordinates. Tests conducted on more than 100 proteins from the BioMagResBank indicate that CS23D converges (i.e. finds a solution) for \&gt;95\% of protein queries. These chemical shift generated structures were found to be within 0.2–2.8 Å RMSD of the NMR structure generated using conventional NOE-base NMR methods or conventional X-ray methods. The performance of CS23D is dependent on the completeness of the chemical shift assignments and the similarity of the query protein to known 3D folds. CS23D is accessible at http://www.cs23d.ca .},

	abstract = {The importance of protein chemical shift values for the determination of three-dimensional protein structure has increased in recent years because of the large databases of protein structures with assigned chemical shift data. These databases have allowed the investigation of the quantitative relationship between chemical shift values obtained by liquid state NMR spectroscopy and the three-dimensional structure of proteins. A neural network was trained to predict the 1H, 13C, and 15N of proteins using their three-dimensional structure as well as experimental conditions as input parameters. It achieves root mean square deviations of 0.3 ppm for hydrogen, 1.3 ppm for carbon, and 2.6 ppm for nitrogen chemical shifts. The model reflects important influences of the covalent structure as well as of the conformation not only for backbone atoms (as, e.g., the chemical shift index) but also for side-chain nuclei. For protein models with a RMSD smaller than 5 Å a correlation of the RMSD and the r.m.s. deviation between the predicted and the experimental chemical shift is obtained. Thus the method has the potential to not only support the assignment process of proteins but also help with the validation and the refinement of three-dimensional structural proposals.

	abstract = {A database of peptide chemical shifts, computed at the density functional level, has been used to develop an algorithm for prediction of 15N and 13C shifts in proteins from their structure; the method is incorporated into a program called SHIFTS (version 4.0). The database was built from the calculated chemical shift patterns of 1335 peptides whose backbone torsion angles are limited to areas of the Ramachandran map around helical and sheet configurations. For each tripeptide in these regions of regular secondary structure (which constitute about 40\% of residues in globular proteins) SHIFTS also consults the database for information about sidechain torsion angle effects for the residue of interest and for the preceding residue, and estimates hydrogen bonding effects through an empirical formula that is also based on density functional calculations on peptides. The program optionally searches for alternate side-chain torsion angles that could significantly improve agreement between calculated and observed shifts. The application of the program on 20 proteins shows good consistency with experimental data, with correlation coefficients of 0.92, 0.98, 0.99 and 0.90 and r.m.s. deviations of 1.94, 0.97, 1.05, and 1.08 ppm for 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ and 13C′, respectively. Reference shifts fit to protein data are in good agreement with `random-coil' values derived from experimental measurements on peptides. This prediction algorithm should be helpful in NMR assignment, crystal and solution structure comparison, and structure refinement.},

To explicitly account for the effects of protein dynamics on chemical shifts, PPM was directly refined against 100 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 35 proteins with known experimental NMR chemical shifts. It is found that the prediction of methyl-proton chemical shifts by PPM from MD ensembles is improved over other methods, while backbone Cα, Cβ, C′, N, and HN chemical shifts are predicted at an accuracy comparable to the latest generation of chemical shift prediction programs.

	abstract = {A new computer program, called SHIFTX2, is described which is capable of rapidly and accurately calculating diamagnetic 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts from protein coordinate data. Compared to its predecessor (SHIFTX) and to other existing protein chemical shift prediction programs, SHIFTX2 is substantially more accurate (up to 26\% better by correlation coefficient with an RMS error that is up to 3.3× smaller) than the next best performing program. It also provides significantly more coverage (up to 10\% more), is significantly faster (up to 8.5×) and capable of calculating a wider variety of backbone and side chain chemical shifts (up to 6×) than many other shift predictors. In particular, SHIFTX2 is able to attain correlation coefficients between experimentally observed and predicted backbone chemical shifts of 0.9800 (15N), 0.9959 (13Cα), 0.9992 (13Cβ), 0.9676 (13C′), 0.9714 (1HN), 0.9744 (1Hα) and RMS errors of 1.1169, 0.4412, 0.5163, 0.5330, 0.1711, and 0.1231 ppm, respectively. The correlation between SHIFTX2’s predicted and observed side chain chemical shifts is 0.9787 (13C) and 0.9482 (1H) with RMS errors of 0.9754 and 0.1723 ppm, respectively. SHIFTX2 is able to achieve such a high level of accuracy by using a large, high quality database of training proteins ({\textgreater}190), by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, by incorporating many more features (χ2 and χ3 angles, solvent accessibility, H-bond geometry, pH, temperature), and by combining sequence-based with structure-based chemical shift prediction techniques. With this substantial improvement in accuracy we believe that SHIFTX2 will open the door to many long-anticipated applications of chemical shift prediction to protein structure determination, refinement and validation.

There are two very different chemical shift standards are being used has led to the appearance of several very different tables for random coil 13C chemical shifts, which has already caused a good deal of confusion within the NMR community. In particular case, chemical shift analysis was applied to a small, flexible peptide to both localize and quantify helix content as a function of TFE concentration. By monitoring the TFE-induced displacement of assigned a-13C resonances, the extent of the relative chemical shift change could be correlated with the intensity of the helical CD signal. These chemical shift plots are reported to provide qualitative details on the flexibility of the molecule and the presence of possible nonnative conformers.},

	abstract = {A computer program (SHIFTX) is described which rapidly and accurately calculates the diamagnetic 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts of both backbone and sidechain atoms in proteins. The program uses a hybrid predictive approach that employs pre-calculated, empirically derived chemical shift hypersurfaces in combination with classical or semi-classical equations (for ring current, electric field, hydrogen bond and solvent effects) to calculate 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts from atomic coordinates. The chemical shift hypersurfaces capture dihedral angle, sidechain orientation, secondary structure and nearest neighbor effects that cannot easily be translated to analytical formulae or predicted via classical means. The chemical shift hypersurfaces were generated using a database of IUPAC-referenced protein chemical shifts – RefDB (Zhang et al., 2003), and a corresponding set of high resolution ({\textless}2.1 Å) X-ray structures. Data mining techniques were used to extract the largest pairwise contributors (from a list of ∼20 derived geometric, sequential and structural parameters) to generate the necessary hypersurfaces. SHIFTX is rapid ({\textless} 1 CPU second for a complete shift calculation of 100 residues) and accurate. Overall, the program was able to attain a correlation coefficient (r) between observed and calculated shifts of 0.911 (1Hα), 0.980 (13Cα), 0.996 (13Cβ), 0.863 (13CO), 0.909 (15N), 0.741 (1HN), and 0.907 (sidechain 1H) with RMS errors of 0.23, 0.98, 1.10, 1.16, 2.43, 0.49, and 0.30 ppm, respectively on test data sets. We further show that the agreement between observed and SHIFTX calculated chemical shifts can be an extremely sensitive measure of the quality of protein structures. Our results suggest that if NMR-derived structures could be refined using heteronuclear chemical shifts calculated by SHIFTX, their precision could approach that of the highest resolution X-ray structures.

	abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100 K). The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast, here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30 different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions of more than 35\% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic, electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique models. Monitoring room-temperature conformational ensembles by X-ray crystallography can reveal motions crucial for catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric regulation.},

Although the principles of relaxation prediction from simulations are well-established, numerous NMR-MD comparisons have hitherto focused upon the aspect of order parameters S2 due to common artifacts in the prediction of transient dynamics. We therefore summarize here all necessary components and highlight existing and proposed solutions, such as the inclusion of quantum mechanical zero-point vibrational corrections and separate MD convergence of global and local motions in coarse-grained and all-atom force fields, respectively. For the accuracy of the MD prediction to be tested, two model proteins GB3 and Ubiquitin are used to validate five atomistic force fields against published NMR data supplemented by the coarse-grained force field MARTINI+EN. In Amber and CHARMM-type force fields, quantitative agreement was achieved for structured elements with minimum adjustment of global parameters. Deviations from experiment occur in flexible loops and termini, indicating differences in both the extent and time scale of backbone motions. The lack of systematic patterns and water model dependence suggests that modeling of the local environment limits prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, qualitative accuracy in a 2 μs CHARMM36m Stam2 VHS domain simulation demonstrates the potential of MD-based interpretation in combination with NMR-measured dynamics, increasing the utility of spin relaxation in integrative structural biology.},

Given that current force fields differ significantly in their α-helical propensities, a correction to match experimental results would be highly desirable. We have determined simple backbone energy corrections for two force fields to reproduce the fraction of helix measured in short peptides at 300 K. As validation, we show that the optimized force fields produce results in excellent agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance experiments for folded proteins and short peptides not used in the optimization. However, despite the agreement at ambient conditions, the dependence of the helix content on temperature is too weak, a problem shared with other force fields. A fit of the Lifson−Roig helix−coil theory shows that both the enthalpy and entropy of helix formation are too small: the helix extension parameter w agrees well with experiment, but its entropic and enthalpic components are both only about half the respective experimental estimates. Our structural and thermodynamic analyses point toward the physical origins of these shortcomings in current force fields, and suggest ways to address them in future force-field development.},

While salt bridges are known to be important both for protein stability, recognition and regulation, we still do not have fully accurate predictive models to assess the energetic contributions of salt bridges. Molecular dynamics simulation is one technique that may be used study the complex relationship between structure, solvation and energetics of salt bridges, but the accuracy of such simulations depends on the force field used. We have used NMR data on the B1 domain of protein G (GB1) to benchmark molecular dynamics simulations. Using enhanced sampling simulations, we calculated the free energy of forming a salt bridge for three possible lysine-carboxylate ionic interactions in GB1. The NMR experiments showed that these interactions are either not formed, or only very weakly formed, in solution. In contrast, we show that the stability of the salt bridges is overestimated, to different extents, in simulations of GB1 using seven out of eight commonly used combinations of fixed charge force fields and water models. We also find that the Amber ff15ipq force field gives rise to weaker salt bridges in good agreement with the NMR experiments. We conclude that many force fields appear to overstabilize these ionic interactions, and that further work may be needed to refine our ability to model quantitatively the stability of salt bridges through simulations. We also suggest that comparisons between NMR experiments and simulations will play a crucial role in furthering our understanding of this important interaction.},

Using a dynamical cluster technique, groups of backbone atoms that move as approximately rigid bodies are derived from the intramolecular interatomic fluctuation matrix. These groups tend to be local in the sequence or connected by disulphide bonds, and contain on average five residues each. X-ray diffuse scattering patterns, which are sensitive to collective motions, are calculated from the full simulation trajectory (including all the protein degrees of freedom). The results reproduce the main features of the experimental scattering. Diffuse scattering is also calculated from fitted trajectories of the rigid bodies. The full simulation diffuse scattering and atomic displacements are found to be well reproduced by a model in which the backbone atoms form the rigid groups determined using the dynamical cluster technique and the individual side-chains behave as separate rigid bodies: the resulting R-factor with the full simulation scattering is 5\%. Quantitatively poorer agreement is obtained from trajectories in which the secondary structural elements of the protein are considered rigid. Rigid whole-molecule and domain motions make only minor contributions to the protein atom displacements. Finally, correlations in the interatomic fluctuations are examined directly using a canonical method.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become increasingly popular in studying the motions and functions of biomolecules. The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the molecular mechanics (MM) force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energies from atomic positions. However, the overall quality of the FF, such as our previously published ff99SB and ff14SB, can be limited by assumptions that were made years ago. In the updated model presented here (ff19SB), we have significantly improved the backbone profiles for all 20 amino acids. We fit coupled φ/ψ parameters using 2D φ/ψ conformational scans for multiple amino acids, using as reference data the entire 2D quantum mechanics (QM) energy surface. We address the polarization inconsistency during dihedral parameter fitting by using both QM and MM in aqueous solution. Finally, we examine possible dependency of the backbone fitting on side chain rotamer. To extensively validate ff19SB parameters, and to compare to results using other Amber models, we have performed a total of ∼5 ms MD simulations in explicit solvent. Our results show that after amino-acid-specific training against QM data with solvent polarization, ff19SB not only reproduces the differences in amino-acid-specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Ramachandran maps better but also shows significantly improved capability to differentiate amino-acid-dependent properties such as helical propensities. We also conclude that an inherent underestimation of helicity is present in ff14SB, which is (inexactly) compensated for by an increase in helical content driven by the TIP3P bias toward overly compact structures. In summary, ff19SB, when combined with a more accurate water model such as OPC, should have better predictive power for modeling sequence-specific behavior, protein mutations, and also rational protein design. Of the explicit water models tested here, we recommend use of OPC with ff19SB.},

	abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure–function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone ϕ, ψ dihedral crossterms or a ϕ, ψ grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the ϕ, ψ dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of ϕ and ψ in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Recent advances in hardware and software have enabled increasingly long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecules, exposing certain limitations in the accuracy of the force fields used for such simulations and spurring efforts to refine these force fields. Recent modifications to the Amber and CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data. Proteins 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The original Trp-cage (NLYIQWLKDGGPSSGRPPPS, Tm = 42°C) can be significantly stabilized by mutations; melting points as high as 64°C are reported. In helical portions of the structure, each allowed replacement of Leu, Ile, Lys or Ser residues by Ala results in a 1.5 (±0.35) kJ/mol fold stabilization. No changes in structure or fluxionality of the core results upon stabilization. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, specific Pro/Trp interactions are not essential for core formation. The entropic advantage of Pro versus Ala (ΔΔSU = 11 ± 2 J/mol K) was measured at the solvent-exposed P17 site. Pro–Ala mutations at two of the three prolines (P12 and P18) that encage the indole ring result in less fold destabilization (2.3–3.4 kJ/mol). However, a P19A mutation reduces fold stability by 16 kJ/mol reflecting a favorable Y3/P19 interaction as well as Trp burial. The Y3/P19 hydrophobic staple interaction defines the folding motif as an 18-residue unit. Other stabilizing features that have been identified include a solvent-exposed Arg/Asp salt bridge (3.4–6 kJ/mol) and a buried H-bonded Ser side chain (≈10 kJ/mol).},

	abstract = {While the quality of the current CHARMM22/CMAP additive force field for proteins has been demonstrated in a large number of applications, limitations in the model with respect to the equilibrium between the sampling of helical and extended conformations in folding simulations have been noted. To overcome this, as well as make other improvements in the model, we present a combination of refinements that should result in enhanced accuracy in simulations of proteins. The common (non-Gly, -Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies of the α-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the α-helical bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by additional empirical optimization targeting NMR scalar couplings for unfolded proteins. A comprehensive validation of the revised force field was then performed against a collection of experimental data: (i) comparison of simulations of eight proteins in their crystal environments with crystal structures; (ii) comparison with backbone scalar couplings for weakly structured peptides; (iii) comparison with NMR residual dipolar couplings and scalar couplings for both backbone and side-chains in folded proteins; (iv) equilibrium folding of mini-proteins. The results indicate that the revised CHARMM 36 parameters represent an improved model for modeling and simulation studies of proteins, including studies of protein folding, assembly, and functionally relevant conformational changes.},

Historically, protein crystal structures have been described using a single set of atomic coordinates. Because conformational variation is important for protein function, researchers now often build models that contain multiple structures. Methods for building such models can fail, however, in regions where the crystallographic density is difficult to interpret, for example at the protein–solvent interface. To address this limitation, a set of MD–MX methods that combine MD simulations of protein crystals with conventional modeling and refinement tools have been developed. In an application to a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase at room temperature, the procedure improved the interpretation of ambiguous density, yielding an alternative water model and a revised protein model including multiple conformations. The revised model provides mechanistic insights into the catalytic and regulatory interactions of the enzyme. The same methods may be used in other MX studies to seek mechanistic insights.},

Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

	abstract = {It is proposed to convert nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) into relatively precise distances for detailed structural studies of proteins. To this purpose, it is demonstrated that the measurement of NOE buildups between amide protons in perdeuterated human ubiquitin using a designed 15N-resolved HMQC-NOESY experiment enables the determination of 1HN−1HN distances up to 5 Å with high accuracy and precision. These NOE-derived distances have an experimental random error of ∼0.07 Å, which is smaller than the pairwise rmsd (root-mean-square deviation) of 0.24 Å obtained with corresponding distances extracted from either an NMR or an X-ray structure (pdb codes: 1D3Z and 1UBQ), and also smaller than the pairwise rmsd between distances from X-ray and NMR structures (0.15 Å). Because the NOE contains both structural and dynamical information, a comparison between the 3D structures and NOE-derived distances may also give insights into through-space dynamics. It appears that the extraction of motional information from NOEs by comparison to the X-ray structure or the NMR structure is challenging because the motion may be masked by the quality of the structures. Nonetheless, a detailed analysis thereof suggests motions between β-strands and large complex motions in the α-helix of ubiquitin. The NOE-derived motions are, however, of smaller amplitude and possibly of a different character than those present in a 20 ns molecular dynamic simulation of ubiquitin in water using the GROMOS force field. Furthermore, a recently published set of structures representing the conformational distribution over time scales up to milliseconds (pdb: 2K39) does not satisfy the NOEs better than the single X-ray structure. Hence, the measurement of possibly thousands of exact NOEs throughout the protein may serve as an excellent probe toward a correct representation of both structure and dynamics of proteins.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

	abstract = {A small change in the Hamiltonian scaling in Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST) is found to improve its sampling efficiency greatly, especially for the sampling of aqueous protein solutions in which there are large-scale solute conformation changes. Like the original REST (REST1), the new version (which we call REST2) also bypasses the poor scaling with system size of the standard Temperature Replica Exchange Method (TREM), reducing the number of replicas (parallel processes) from what must be used in TREM. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST2 is compared with TREM and with REST1 for the folding of the trpcage and β-hairpin in water. The comparisons confirm that REST2 greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and greatly increases the sampling efficiency over REST1. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water.},

Using a curated test set of 52 high-resolution structures, 39 derived from X-ray diffraction and 13 solved using NMR, we consider the extent to which different parameter sets of the GROMOS protein force field can be distinguished based on comparing a range of structural criteria, including the number of backbone hydrogen bonds, the number of native hydrogen bonds, polar and nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area, radius of gyration, the prevalence of secondary structure elements, J-coupling constants, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) intensities, positional root-mean-square deviations (RMSD), and the distribution of backbone ϕ and ψ dihedral angles. It is shown that while statistically significant differences between the average values of individual metrics could be detected, these were in general small. Furthermore, improvements in agreement in one metric were often offset by loss of agreement in another. The work establishes a framework and test set against which protein force fields can be validated. It also highlights the danger of inferring the relative quality of a given force field based on a small range of structural properties or small number of proteins.},

	abstract = {This article describes an unexpected phenomenon encountered during MD simulations: velocity rescaling using standard protocols can systematically change the proportion of total kinetic energy (KE) found in motions associated with the various degrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the simulation violates the principle of equipartition of energy, which requires a mean kinetic energy of RT/2 in each degree of freedom. A particularly pathological form of this problem occurs if one does not periodically remove the net translation of (and rotation about) the center of mass. In this case, almost all of the kinetic energy is converted into these two kinds of motion, producing a system with almost no kinetic energy associated with the internal degrees of freedom. We call this phenomenon “the flying ice cube.” We present a mathematical analysis of a simple diatomic system with two degrees of freedom, to document the origin of the problem. We then present examples from three kinds of MD simulations, one being an in vacuo simulation on a diatomic system, one involving a low resolution model of DNA in vacuo, and the third using a traditional all-atom DNA model with full solvation, periodic boundary conditions, and the particle mesh Ewald method for treating long-range electrostatics. Finally, we discuss methods for avoiding the problem. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 19: 726–740, 1998},

Since the goal of this study is to lay out the framework and validate the concept, it focuses on Asp and Glu residues where the protein pKa values and structures are assumed to be more reliable. The new and improved implementation is evaluated and discussed; it is found to agree better with experiment than the previous implementation (in parentheses): rmsd = 0.79 (0.91) for Asp and Glu, 0.75 (0.97) for Tyr, 0.65 (0.72) for Lys, and 1.00 (1.37) for His residues. The most significant advance, however, is in reducing the number of outliers and removing unreasonable sensitivity to small structural changes that arise from classifying residues as either internal or surface.},

	abstract = {The flying ice cube effect is a molecular dynamics simulation artifact in which the use of velocity rescaling thermostats sometimes causes violation of the equipartition theorem, affecting both structural and dynamic properties. The reason for this artifact and the conditions under which it occurs have not been fully understood. Since the flying ice cube effect was first demonstrated, a new velocity rescaling algorithm (the CSVR thermostat) has been developed and become popular without its effects on the equipartition theorem being truly known. Meanwhile, the use of simple velocity rescaling and Berendsen (weak coupling) thermostat algorithms has not abated but has actually continued to grow. Here, we have calculated the partitioning of the kinetic energy between translational, rotational, and vibrational modes in simulations of diatomic molecules to explicitly determine whether the equipartition theorem is violated under different thermostats and while rescaling velocities to different kinetic energy distributions. We have found that the underlying cause of the flying ice cube effect is a violation of balance leading to systematic redistributions of kinetic energy under simple velocity rescaling and the Berendsen thermostat. When velocities are instead rescaled to the canonical ensemble’s kinetic energy distribution, as is done with the CSVR thermostat, the equipartition theorem is not violated, and we show that the CSVR thermostat satisfies detailed balance. The critical necessity for molecular dynamics practitioners to abandon the use of popular yet incorrect velocity rescaling algorithms is underscored with an example demonstrating that the main result of a highly cited study is entirely due to artifacts resulting from the study’s use of the Berendsen thermostat.},

	abstract = {Periodic molecular dynamics simulations of proteins may suffer from image interactions. Similarly, the hydrophobic effect required to keep a protein folded may not be enforced by small simulation cells. Accordingly, errors may arise both from the water concentration per se and the image interactions. Intrinsically disordered proteins are particularly sensitive, providing a worst-case estimate of the errors. Following this reasoning, we studied Aβ40 (Aβ), a disordered peptide central to Alzheimer’s disease, by 100 different simulations with variable cell size from very large (20 Å) to very small (3 Å). Even for this very disordered peptide, most properties are not cell-size dependent, justifying the common use of modest-sized (10 Å) cells for simulating proteins. The radius of gyration, secondary structure, intrapeptide, and peptide-water hydrogen bonds are similar relative to standard deviations at any cell size. However, hydrophobic surface area increases significantly in small cells (confidence 95\%, two-tailed t-test), as does the standard deviation in exposure and backbone conformations (\&gt;40\% and \&gt;27\%). Similar results were obtained for the force fields OPLS3e, Ambersb99-ILDN, and Charmm22*. The similar prevalence of structures and α-β transitions in long and short simulations indicate small diffusion barriers, which we suggest is a defining hallmark of intrinsically disordered proteins. Whereas hydrophilic exposure dominates in large cells, hydrophobic exposure dominates in small cells, suggesting a weakening of the hydrophobic effect by image interactions and the few water layers available to keep the protein compact, with a critical limit of 2–3 water layers required to enforce the hydrophobic effect.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction from sequence alone by “brute force” random methods is a computationally expensive problem. Estimates have suggested that it could take all the computers in the world longer than the age of the universe to compute the structure of a single 200-residue protein. Here we investigate the use of a faster version of our FOLDTRAJ probabilistic all-atom protein-structure-sampling algorithm. We have improved the method so that it is now over twenty times faster than originally reported, and capable of rapidly sampling conformational space without lattices. It uses geometrical constraints and a Leonard-Jones type potential for self-avoidance. We have also implemented a novel method to add secondary structure-prediction information to make protein-like amounts of secondary structure in sampled structures. In a set of 100,000 probabilistic conformers of 1VII, 1ENH, and 1PMC generated, the structures with smallest Cα RMSD from native are 3.95, 5.12, and 5.95Å, respectively. Expanding this test to a set of 17 distinct protein folds, we find that all-helical structures are “hit” by brute force more frequently than β or mixed structures. For small helical proteins or very small non-helical ones, this approach should have a “hit” close enough to detect with a good scoring function in a pool of several million conformers. By fitting the distribution of RMSDs from the native state of each of the 17 sets of conformers to the extreme value distribution, we are able to estimate the size of conformational space for each. With a 0.5Å RMSD cutoff, the number of conformers is roughly 2N where N is the number of residues in the protein. This is smaller than previous estimates, indicating an average of only two possible conformations per residue when sterics are accounted for. Our method reduces the effective number of conformations available at each residue by probabilistic bias, without requiring any particular discretization of residue conformational space, and is the fastest method of its kind. With computer speeds doubling every 18 months and parallel and distributed computing becoming more practical, the brute force approach to protein structure prediction may yet have some hope in the near future.

	abstract = {A fast computer program, FOLDTRAJ, to generate plausible random protein structures is reported. All-atom proteins are made directly in continuous three-dimensional space starting from primary sequence with an N to C directed build-up method. The method uses a novel pipelined residue addition approach in which the leading edge of the protein is constructed three residues at a time for optimal protein geometry, including the placement of cis proline. Build-up methods represent a classic N-body problem, expected to scale as N2. When proteins become more collapsed, build-up methods are susceptible to backtracking problems which can scale exponentially with the number of residues required to back out of a trapped walk. We have provided solutions to both these problems, using a multiway binary tree that makes the N-body problem of bump-checking scale as NlogN, and speeding up backtracking by varying the number of tries before backtracking based on available conformational space. FOLDTRAJ is independent of energy potentials, other than that implicit in the geometrical properties derived by statistical studies of known structures, and in atomic Van der Waals radii. WHAT―CHECK shows that the program generates chirally and physically valid proteins with all bond lengths, angles and dihedrals within allowable tolerances. Random structures built using sequences from PDB files 1SEM, 2HPR, and 1RTP typically have 5–15\% α-helical content (according to DSSP) and on the order of 20\% β-strand/extended content. Ensembles of random structures are compared with polymer theory and with experimentally determined fluorescence resonance energy transfer distances. Reasonably sized structure ensembles do sample most of the conformational space available to proteins. The method is also capable of protein reconstruction using CαCα direction vectors, and it compares favorably with methods that reconstruct protein backbones based on alpha-carbon coordinates, having an average backbone and Cβ root mean square deviation of 0.63 Å for nine different protein folds.

	abstract = {Motivation: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) represent a significant fraction of the human proteome. The classical structure function paradigm that has successfully underpinned our understanding of molecular biology breaks down when considering proteins that have no stable tertiary structure in their functional form. One convenient approach is to describe the protein in terms of an equilibrium of rapidly inter-converting conformers. Currently, tools to generate such ensemble descriptions are extremely rare, and poorly adapted to the prediction of experimental data.Results: We present flexible-meccano—a highly efficient algorithm that generates ensembles of molecules, on the basis of amino acid-specific conformational potentials and volume exclusion. Conformational sampling depends uniquely on the primary sequence, with the possibility of introducing additional local or long-range conformational propensities at an amino acid-specific resolution. The algorithm can also be used to calculate expected values of experimental parameters measured at atomic or molecular resolution, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small angle scattering, respectively. We envisage that flexible-meccano will be useful for researchers who wish to compare experimental data with those expected from a fully disordered protein, researchers who see experimental evidence of deviation from ‘random coil’ behaviour in their protein, or researchers who are interested in working with a broad ensemble of conformers representing the flexibility of the IDP of interest.Availability: A fully documented multi-platform executable is provided, with examples, at http://www.ibs.fr/science-213/scientific-output/software/flexible-meccano/Contact:  martin.blackledge@ibs.fr},

Recent developments in MD have afforded methods capable of simulating both ordered and disordered proteins, yet to date, accurate fold prediction from a sequence has been dominated by Monte Carlo (MC)-based methods such as Rosetta. To overcome the limitations of current approaches in IDP simulation using Rosetta while maintaining its utility for modeling folded domains, we developed PyRosetta-based algorithms that allow for the accurate de novo prediction of proteins across all degrees of foldedness along with structural ensembles of disordered proteins.

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play fundamental roles in signaling, regulation, and cell homeostasis by specifically interacting with their partners. The structural characterization of these interacting regions remains challenging and requires the integration of extensive experimental information. Here we present an approach that exploits the structural information encoded in tripeptide fragments from coil regions of high-resolution structures. Our results indicate that a simple building approach that disregards the sequence context provides a good structural representation of fully disordered regions. Conversely, the description of partially structured motifs calls for the consideration of sequence-dependent structural preferences. By using nuclear magnetic resonance residual dipolar couplings and small-angle X-ray scattering data for multiple IDPs we demonstrate that the appropriate combination of these two building strategies produces ensemble models that correctly describe the secondary structural classes and the population of partially structured regions. This study paves the way for the extension of structure prediction and protein design to disordered proteins.},

IDPConformerGenerator samples backbone phi (φ), psi (ψ), and omega (ω) torsion angles of relevant sequence fragments from loops and secondary structure elements extracted from folded protein structures in the RCSB Protein Data Bank and builds side chains from robust Monte Carlo algorithms using expanded rotamer libraries. IDPConformerGenerator has many user-defined options enabling variable fractional sampling of secondary structures, supports Bayesian models for assessing the agreement of IDP ensembles for consistency with experimental data, and introduces a machine learning approach to transform between internal and Cartesian coordinates with reduced error.

To address new research applications and advancing computational capabilities, we have continually updated APBS and its suite of accompanying software since its release in 2001.

This review aims to present the unifying principles of and differences between many of the computational methods currently used for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. In fact, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical and physical concepts. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using similar terminology and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine features of a relatively small number of the same enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding of the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of the ideas that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them.

Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.},

	abstract = {To compare ordered water positions from experiment with those from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a number of MD models of water structure in crystalline endoglucanase were calculated. The starting MD model was derived from a joint X-ray and neutron diffraction crystal structure, enabling the use of experimentally assigned protonation states. Simulations were performed in the crystalline state, using a periodic 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with explicit solvent. Water X-ray and neutron scattering density maps were computed from MD trajectories using standard macromolecular crystallography methods. In one set of simulations, harmonic restraints were applied to bias the protein structure toward the crystal structure. For these simulations, the recall of crystallographic waters using strong peaks in the MD water electron density was very good, and there also was substantial visual agreement between the boomerang-like wings of the neutron scattering density and the crystalline water hydrogen positions. An unrestrained simulation also was performed. For this simulation, the recall of crystallographic waters was much lower. For both restrained and unrestrained simulations, the strongest water density peaks were associated with crystallographic waters. The results demonstrate that it is now possible to recover crystallographic water structure using restrained MD simulations but that it is not yet reasonable to expect unrestrained MD simulations to do the same. Further development and generalization of MD water models for force-field development, macromolecular crystallography, and medicinal chemistry applications is now warranted. In particular, the combination of room-temperature crystallography, neutron diffraction, and crystalline MD simulations promises to substantially advance modeling of biomolecular solvation.},

The results of these analyses indicate that all three combinations performed well on helical peptides. As for β-hairpins, ff19SB performed well with both solvation methods, with a slight preference for the TIP3P solvation model, even though performance was dependent on both peptide sequence and initial conformation.

It therefore forms the basis for all molecular dynamics simulations of biological phenomena, as well as for many chemical, industrial, and materials investigations. Over the years, many water models have been developed, and it remains a challenge to find a single water model that accurately reproduces all experimental properties of water simultaneously. Here, we report a comprehensive comparison of structural and dynamic properties of 30 commonly used 3-point, 4-point, 5-point, and polarizable water models simulated using consistent settings and analysis methods. For the properties of density, coordination number, surface tension, dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficient, and solvation free energy of methane, models published within the past two decades consistently show better agreement with experimental values compared to models published earlier, albeit with some notable exceptions. However, no single model reproduced all experimental values exactly, highlighting the need to carefully choose a water model for a particular study, depending on the phenomena of interest. Finally, machine learning algorithms quantified the relationship between the water model force field parameters and the resulting bulk properties, providing insight into the parameter–property relationship and illustrating the challenges of developing a water model that can accurately reproduce all properties of water simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have no fixed three-dimensional (3D) structures under physiological conditions, with the content being about 51\% in human proteomics. IDPs are associated with many human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Because IDPs do not crystallize and have diverse conformers, traditional experimental methods such as crystallization and NMR can hardly capture their conformation ensemble and just provide average structural characters of IDPs. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations become a valuable complement to the experimental data. However, the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulation for IDPs depends on the combination of force fields and solvent models. Recently, we released an environment-specific force field (ESFF1) for IDPs, which can well reproduce the local structural properties (such as J-coupling and secondary chemical shifts). However, there is still a large deviation for the radius of gyration (Rg). Therefore, a solvent model combined with ESFF1 is necessary to capture the local and global characters for IDPs and ordered proteins. Here, we investigated the underestimation or overestimation of the solvent interaction for four solvent models (TIP3P, TIP4P-Ew, TIP4P-D, OPC) under ESFF1 and found the important ε parameter of the solvent model to play a key role in scaling Rg. A near-linear relationship between the simulation Rg and the ε parameter was used to develop the new solvent model, named TIP4P-B. The results indicate that the simulated Rg with TIP4P-B is in better agreement with the experimental observations than the other four solvent models. Simultaneously, TIP4P-B can also maintain the advantages of the ESFF1 force field for the local structural properties. Additionally, TIP4P-B can successfully sample the conformation of ordered proteins. These findings confirm that TIP4P-B is a balanced solvent model and can improve sampling Rg performance for folded proteins and IDPs.},

	abstract = {Molecular simulations of nanoscale systems invariably involve assumptions and approximations to describe the electrostatic interactions, which are long-ranged in nature. One approach is the use of cutoff schemes with a reaction-field contribution to account for the medium outside the cutoff scheme. Recent reports show that macroscopic properties may depend on the exact choice of cutoff schemes in modern day simulations. In this work, a systematic analysis of the effects of different cutoff schemes was performed using a set of 52 proteins. We find no statistically significant differences between using a twin-range or a single-range cutoff scheme. Applying the cutoff based on charge groups or based on atomic positions, does lead to significant differences, which is traced to the cutoff noise for energies and forces. While group-based cutoff schemes show increased cutoff noise in the potential energy, applying an atomistic cutoff leads to artificial structure in the solvent at the cutoff distance. Carefully setting the temperature control, or using an atomistic cutoff for the solute and a group-based cutoff for the solvent significantly reduces the effects of the cutoff noise, without introducing structure in the solvent. This study aims to deepen the understanding of the implications different cutoffs have on molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {During the past half century, the number and accuracy of experimental techniques that can deliver values of observables for biomolecular systems have been steadily increasing. The conversion of a measured value Qexp of an observable quantity Q into structural information is, however, a task beset with theoretical and practical problems: 1) insufficient or inaccurate values of Qexp, 2) inaccuracies in the function used to relate the quantity Q to structure , 3) how to account for the averaging inherent in the measurement of Qexp, 4) how to handle the possible multiple-valuedness of the inverse of the function , to mention a few. These apply to a variety of observable quantities Q and measurement techniques such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering, free-electron laser imaging, cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, circular dichroism, Förster resonance energy transfer, atomic force microscopy and ion-mobility mass spectrometry. The process of deriving structural information from measured data is reviewed with an eye to non-experts and newcomers in the field using examples from the literature of the effect of the various choices and approximations involved in the process. A list of choices to be avoided is provided.},

	abstract = {Long-range lattice summation techniques such as the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm for electrostatics have been revolutionary to the precision and accuracy of molecular simulations in general. Despite the performance penalty associated with lattice summation electrostatics, few biomolecular simulations today are performed without it. There are increasingly strong arguments for moving in the same direction for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions, and by using geometric approximations of the combination rules in reciprocal space, we have been able to make a very high-performance implementation available in GROMACS. Here, we present a new way to correct for these approximations to achieve exact treatment of Lorentz–Berthelot combination rules within the cutoff, and only a very small approximation error remains outside the cutoff (a part that would be completely ignored without LJ-PME). This not only improves accuracy by almost an order of magnitude but also achieves absolute biomolecular simulation performance that is an order of magnitude faster than any other available lattice summation technique for LJ interactions. The implementation includes both CPU and GPU acceleration, and its combination with improved scaling LJ-PME simulations now provides performance close to the truncated potential methods in GROMACS but with much higher accuracy.},

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations.We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.},

	abstract = {Magnetic relaxation times of hydrogen and fluorine in anhydrous hydrofluoric acid cannot be accounted for on the assumption of a pure dipole‐dipole interaction between the hydrogen and the fluorine nuclei in the same molecule. However, the introduction, in the Hamiltonian, of a scalar term AI·S resulting from the indirect electron‐coupled interaction between the two nuclei removes all the discrepancies between the calculated and observed decay times. Although the splitting due to this scalar term is smeared out by the rapid chemical exchange of the protons with the traces of water present in the acid, the nuclear Overhauser effect provides the extra parameter required to separate the dipole‐dipole interaction from the scalar interaction and to calculate separately the scalar splitting and the exchange rate of the protons. The value obtained for the splitting is A/h=615 cps.The same method has been applied to investigate the structure of the HF molecule in solutions. The experimental results can be explained qualitatively by the following picture: (a) The fluorine nuclei form long chains that move more slowly than the Larmor frequency of fluorine. (b) The chemical exchange with the relatively large quantity of water present makes the motion of the hydrogen nuclei fast with respect to the hydrogen Larmor frequency. The results are: Long relaxation times for hydrogen with T1 and T2 equal, relatively short relaxation times for fluorine resonance, with T2 shorter than T1.Solutions of salts of hydrofluoric acid (KF) show the same character as solutions of the acid.},

We present a high-resolution experimental approach based on the total scattering from protein crystals at room temperature (TS/RT-MX) that captures both structure and collective motions. To reveal the scattering signal from protein motions, we present a general workflow that enables robust subtraction of lattice disorder. The workflow introduces two methods: GOODVIBES, a detailed and refinable lattice disorder model based on the rigid-body vibrations of a crystalline elastic network; and DISCOBALL, an independent method of validation that estimates the displacement covariance between proteins in the lattice in real space. Here, we demonstrate the robustness of this workflow and further demonstrate how it can be interfaced with MD simulations towards obtaining high-resolution insight into functionally important protein motions.},

	abstract = {A backbone-dependent rotamer library for amino acid side-chains is developed and used for constructing protein side-chain conformations from the main-chain co-ordinates. The rotamer library is obtained from 132 protein chains in the Brookhaven Protein Database. A grid of 20° by 20° blocks for the main-chain angles φ,ψ is used in the rotamer library. Significant correlations are found between side-chain dihedral angle probabilities and backbone φ,ψ values. These probabilities are used to place the side-chain on the known backbone in the test application for six proteins for which high-resolution crystal structures are available. A minimization scheme is used to reorient side-chains that conflict with the backbone or other side-chains after the initial placement. The initial placement yields 59\% of both χ1 and χ2 values in the correct position (to within 40°) for thermolysin to 81\% for crambin. After refinement the values range from 61\% (lysozyme) to 89\% (crambin). It is evident from the results that a single protein does not adequately test a prediction scheme. The computation time required by the method scales linearly with the number of side-chains. An initial prediction from the library takes only a few seconds of computer time, while the iterative refinement takes on the order of hours. The method is automated and can easily be applied to aid experimental side-chain determinations and homology modeling. The high degree of correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations may introduce a simplification in the protein folding process by reducing the available conformational space.},

Most simulations of globular proteins in solution begin by surrounding the crystal structure of the monomer in a bath of water molecules, but the standard simulation employing periodic boundary conditions is already close to a crystal lattice environment. With simple protocols, the same software and molecular models can perform simulations of the crystal lattice, including all asymmetric units and solvent to fill the box. Throughout the history of molecular dynamics, studies of crystal lattices have served to investigate the quality of the underlying force fields, correlate the simulated ensembles to experimental structure factors, and extrapolate the behavior in lattices to behavior in solution. Powerful new computers are enabling molecular simulations with greater realism and statistical convergence. Meanwhile, the advent of exciting new methods in crystallography, including femtosecond free-electron lasers and image reconstruction for time-resolved crystallography on slurries of small crystals, is expanding the range of structures accessible to X-ray diffraction. We review past fusions of simulations and crystallography, then look ahead to the ways that simulations of crystal structures will enhance structural biology in the future.

	abstract = {Development of the AMOEBA (atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular simulation) force field for proteins is presented. The current version (AMOEBA-2013) utilizes permanent electrostatic multipole moments through the quadrupole at each atom, and explicitly treats polarization effects in various chemical and physical environments. The atomic multipole electrostatic parameters for each amino acid residue type are derived from high-level gas phase quantum mechanical calculations via a consistent and extensible protocol. Molecular polarizability is modeled via a Thole-style damped interactive induction model based upon distributed atomic polarizabilities. Inter- and intramolecular polarization is treated in a consistent fashion via the Thole model. The intramolecular polarization model ensures transferability of electrostatic parameters among different conformations, as demonstrated by the agreement between QM and AMOEBA electrostatic potentials, and dipole moments of dipeptides. The backbone and side chain torsional parameters were determined by comparing to gas-phase QM (RI-TRIM MP2/CBS) conformational energies of dipeptides and to statistical distributions from the Protein Data Bank. Molecular dynamics simulations are reported for short peptides in explicit water to examine their conformational properties in solution. Overall the calculated conformational free energies and J-coupling constants are consistent with PDB statistics and experimental NMR results, respectively. In addition, the experimental crystal structures of a number of proteins are well maintained during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While further calculations are necessary to fully validate the force field, initial results suggest the AMOEBA polarizable multipole force field is able to describe the structure and energetics of peptides and proteins, in both gas-phase and solution environments.},

	abstract = {Presented is a polarizable force field based on a classical Drude oscillator framework, currently implemented in the programs CHARMM and NAMD, for modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of peptides and proteins. Building upon parameters for model compounds representative of the functional groups in proteins, the development of the force field focused on the optimization of the parameters for the polypeptide backbone and the connectivity between the backbone and side chains. Optimization of the backbone electrostatic parameters targeted quantum mechanical conformational energies, interactions with water, molecular dipole moments and polarizabilities, and experimental condensed phase data for short polypeptides such as (Ala)5. Additional optimization of the backbone ϕ, ψ conformational preferences included adjustments of the tabulated two-dimensional spline function through the CMAP term. Validation of the model included simulations of a collection of peptides and proteins. This first generation polarizable model is shown to maintain the folded state of the studied systems on the 100 ns time scale in explicit solvent MD simulations. The Drude model typically yields larger RMS differences as compared to the additive CHARMM36 force field (C36) and shows additional flexibility as compared to the additive model. Comparison with NMR chemical shift data shows a small degradation of the polarizable model with respect to the additive, though the level of agreement may be considered satisfactory. However, the polarizable model shows improvement for the residues with significantly underestimated S2 order parameters in the additive model. Analysis of dipole moments associated with the peptide backbone and tryptophan side chains show the Drude model to have considerably larger values than those present in C36, with the dipole moments of the peptide backbone enhanced to a greater extent in sheets versus helices and the dipoles of individual moieties observed to undergo large variations during the MD simulations. Although there are still some limitations, the presented model, termed Drude-2013, is anticipated to yield a molecular picture of peptide and protein structure and function that will be of increased physical validity and internal consistency in a computationally accessible fashion.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of atomistic physics-based force fields for the simulation of biological macromolecules has typically been benchmarked experimentally using biophysical data from simple, often single-chain systems. In the case of proteins, the careful refinement of force field parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials and the use of improved water models have enabled a great deal of progress toward the highly accurate simulation of such monomeric systems in both folded and, more recently, disordered states. In living organisms, however, proteins constantly interact with other macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and these interactions are often essential for proper biological function. Here, we show that state-of-the-art force fields tuned to provide an accurate description of both ordered and disordered proteins can be limited in their ability to accurately describe protein–protein complexes. This observation prompted us to perform an extensive reparameterization of one variant of the Amber protein force field. Our objective involved refitting not only the parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials but also the parameters used to model nonbonded interactions, the specification of which is expected to be central to the accurate description of multicomponent systems. The resulting force field, which we call DES-Amber, allows for more accurate simulations of protein–protein complexes, while still providing a state-of-the-art description of both ordered and disordered single-chain proteins. Despite the improvements, calculated protein–protein association free energies still appear to deviate substantially from experiment, a result suggesting that more fundamental changes to the force field, such as the explicit treatment of polarization effects, may simultaneously further improve the modeling of single-chain proteins and protein–protein complexes.},

The performance and accuracy of the software is demonstrated with experimentally characterized protein systems: HIV-1 protease, T4 Lysozyme and Acyl-CoA-binding protein.

The large computational effort associated with such modelling with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be avoided by a rotamer library approach based on a coarse-grained representation of the conformational space of the spin label. We show here that libraries of about 200 rotamers, obtained by iterative projection of a long MD trajectory of the free spin label onto a set of canonical dihedral angles, provide a representation of the underlying trajectory adequate for EPR distance measurements. Rotamer analysis was performed on selected X-ray structures of spin labelled T4 lysozyme mutants to characterize the spin label rotamer ensemble on a single protein site. Furthermore, predictions based on the rotamer library approach are shown to be in nearly quantitative agreement with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance data on the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA and on the light-harvesting complex LHCII whose structures are known from independent cryo electron microscopy and X-ray studies, respectively. Suggestions for the selection of labelling sites in proteins are given, limitations of the approach discussed, and requirements for further development are outlined.},

Refinement necessitates the use of an ensemble representation of the paramagnetic center and a model-free extension of the Solomon–Bloembergen equations. In the fast exchange regime, the PRE provides insight into dynamic processes and the existence of transient, low population intermediate species. The PRE allows one to characterize dynamic nonspecific binding of a protein to DNA; to directly demonstrate that the search process whereby a transcription factor locates its specific DNA target site involves both intramolecular (sliding) and intermolecular (hopping and intersegment transfer) translocation; and to detect and visualize the distribution of an ensemble of transient encounter complexes in protein–protein association.},

This complementarity offers unique opportunities, provided that the two methods are compared at a suitable level. Recently, several groups have used MD simulations to compute the spectral density of backbone and side chain molecular motions and to predict NMR relaxation rates from these. Unfortunately, in the case of methyl groups in protein side chains, inaccurate energy barriers to methyl rotation were responsible for a systematic discrepancy in the computed relaxation rates, as demonstrated for the AMBER ff99SB*-ILDN force field (and related parameter sets), impairing quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments. However, correspondence could be regained by emending the MD force field with accurate coupled cluster quantum chemical calculations. Spurred by this positive result, we tested whether this approach could be generally applicable, in spite of the fact that different MD force fields employ different water models. Improved methyl group rotation barriers for the CHARMM36 and AMBER ff15ipq protein force fields were derived, such that the NMR relaxation data obtained from the MD simulations even now display very good agreement with the experiment. Results herein showcase the performance of present-day MD force fields and manifest their refined ability to accurately describe internal protein dynamics.},

Extensive and engaging, the Second Edition of the leading reference on the NOE is significantly updated to reflect the latest changes and new approaches in the field. Neuhaus and Williamson provide an essential guide to the complexities and use of the NOE in a readily accessible, straightforward manner. Their practical handbook features a new chapter addressing the use of NOE data to calculate biomolecular structures. Chapters dealing with the kinetics of the NOE, the effects of exchange and internal motion, and applications of the NOE, are also extensively revised. Cross-referenced in remarkable depth, The Nuclear Overhauser Effect is organized into three main parts: * Part I describes the theory of the Nuclear Overhauser Effect in a clear, comprehensive fashion * Part II discusses the considerations involved in implementing NOE experiments, including full coverage of all necessary details for both new and established techniques * Part III offers examples of how the NOE is used, including applications to defining molecular geometry, stereochemistry, conformation, and biomolecular structure and interactions The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis, Second Edition, uniquely explains the NOE in detail, making it an indispensable resource for the novice as well as the experienced NMR researcher.},

Using a combined data set of experimental coupling constants from ubiquitin and staphylococcal nuclease (Delaglio et al., 1991), the angular dependence of the coupling constants on the backbone angles ψand φwas investigated. It was found that the size of 2J(Ni,Cα (i − 1)) correlates strongly with the backbone conformation, while only a weak conformational dependence on the size of 1J(Ni,Cα i) coupling constants was observed. Coupling constants in the denatured state of ubiquitin were uniform along the sequence of the protein and not dependent on a given residue type.

The relative importance of the weighting factors for the ϕ/ψ/χ1 angles and sequence similarity was optimized empirically. The weighted, average secondary shifts of the central residues in the 20 best-matching triplets, after inclusion of nearest neighbor, ring current, and hydrogen bonding effects, are used to predict chemical shifts for the protein of known structure.

	abstract = {A method for structure refinement of molecules based on residual dipolar coupling (RDC) data is proposed. It calculates RDC values using magnetic-field rotational sampling of the rotational degrees of freedom of a molecule in conjunction with molecule-internal configurational sampling. By applying rotational sampling, as is occurring in the experiment, leading to observable RDCs, the method stays close to the experiment. It avoids the use of an alignment tensor and, therefore, the assumptions that the overall rotation of the molecule is decoupled from its internal motions and that the molecule is rigid. Two simple molecules, a relatively rigid and a very flexible cyclo-octane molecule with eight aliphatic side chains containing 24 united atoms, serve as so-called “toy model” test systems. The method demonstrates the influence of molecular flexibility, force-field dominance, and the number of RDC restraints available on the outcome of structure refinement based on RDCs. Magnetic-field rotational sampling is basically equivalent but more efficient than explicitly sampling the rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule. In addition, the performance of the method is less dependent on the number NRDC of measured RDC-values available. The restraining forces bias the overall orientation distribution of the molecule correctly. This study suggests that the information content of RDCs with respect to molecular structure is limited.},

	abstract = {Besides their structure, dynamics is pivotal for protein functions, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that do not fold into a fixed 3D structure. However, the detection of protein dynamics is difficult for IDPs and other disordered biomolecules. NMR spin relaxation rates are sensitive to the rapid rotations of chemical bonds, but their interpretation is arduous for IDPs or molecular assemblies with a complex dynamic landscape. Here we demonstrate numerically that the dynamics of a wide range of proteins, from short peptides to partially disordered proteins and peptides in micelles, can be characterized by calculating the total effective correlation times of protein backbone N–H bond rotations, τeff, from experimentally measured transverse 15N spin relaxation rates, R2, using a linear relation. Our results enable the determination of magnetic-field-independent and intuitively understandable parameters describing protein dynamics at different regions of the sequence directly from experiments. A practical advance of the approach is demonstrated by analyzing partially disordered proteins in which rotations of disordered regions occur with timescales of 1–2 ns, independent of their size, suggesting that rotations of disordered and folded regions are uncoupled in these proteins.},

	abstract = {Abstract Multi-domain proteins, comprising both folded and intrinsically disordered regions, play pivotal roles in various biological processes, yet characterizing their conformational ensembles and dynamics presents significant challenges. Here we introduce the Quality Evaluation Based Simulation Selection (QEBSS) protocol to address this challenge by systematically selecting ensembles from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data that enable detailed interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. QEBSS is based on quality evaluation of large number of MD simulation trajectories against protein backbone 15N T1 and T2 spin relaxation times and hetNOE values from NMR experiments, and concomitant selection of simulations that form the best ensemble for the interpretation of experiments. We demonstrate the practical advantage of QEBSS by solving conformational ensembles and dynamics of four flexible multi-domain proteins: calmodulin, CDNF, MANF, and EN2. These proteins bear important biological functions but their mechanistic understanding is limited partially due to challenges in characterization of flexible multi-domain proteins. Our findings reveal new insights on conformational landscapes and dynamics of these proteins, shining light also on their biological functions. QEBSS offers a systematic approach to resolve conformational ensembles and dynamics of multi-domain proteins with heterogeneous dynamics. Because such proteins play important roles in wide range of systems with relevance in biology, biotechnology and material sciences, we anticipate QEBSS to benefit wide range of fields ranging from drug design to development of novel materials.},

	abstract = {Peptides or proteins containing small biomolecular aggregates, such as micelles, bicelles, droplets and nanodiscs, are pivotal in many fields ranging from structural biology to pharmaceutics. Monitoring dynamics of such systems has been limited by the lack of experimental methods that could directly detect their fast (picosecond to nanosecond) timescale dynamics. Spin relaxation times from NMR experiments are sensitive to such motions, but their interpretation for biomolecular aggregates is not straightforward. Here we show that the dynamic landscape of peptide-containing molecular assemblies can be determined by a synergistic combination of solution state NMR experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Solution state NMR experiments are straightforward to implement without an excessive amount of sample, while direct combination of spin relaxation data to MD simulations enables interpretation of dynamic landscapes of peptides and other aggregated molecules. To demonstrate this, we interpret NMR data from transmembrane, peripheral, and tail anchored peptides embedded in micelles. Our results indicate that peptides and detergent molecules do not rotate together as a rigid body, but peptides rotate in a viscous medium composed of detergent micelle. Spin relaxation times also provide indirect information on peptide conformational ensembles. This work gives new perspectives on peptide dynamics in complex biomolecular assemblies.},

	abstract = {The technique of small-probe contact dot surfaces is described as a method for calculating and displaying the detailed atomic contacts inside or between molecules. It allows one both to measure and to visualize directly the goodness-of-fit of packing interactions. It requires both highly accurate structures and also the explicit inclusion of all hydrogen atoms and their van der Waals interactions. A reference dataset of 100 protein structures was chosen on the basis of resolution (1.7 Å or better), crystallographic R-value, non-homology, and the absence of any unusual problems. Hydrogen atoms were added in standard geometry and, where needed, with rotational optimization of OH, SH, and NH3+ positions. Side-chain amide orientations were corrected where required by NH van der Waals clashes, as described in the accompanying paper. It was determined that, in general, methyl groups pack well in the default staggered conformation, except for the terminal methyl groups of methionine residues, which required rotational optimization. The distribution of serious clashes (i.e. non-H-bond overlap of ⩾0.4 Å) was studied as a function of resolution, alternate conformations, and temperature factor (B), leading to the decision that packing and other structural features would not be analyzed for residues in ‘b’ alternate conformations or with B-factors of 40 or above. At the level of the fine details analyzed here, structural accuracy improves quite significantly over the range from 1.7 to 1.0 Å resolution. These high-resolution structures show impressively well-fitted packing interactions, with some regions thoroughly interdigitated and other regions somewhat sparser. Lower-resolution structures or model structures could undoubtedly be improved in accuracy by the incorporation of this additional information: for example, nucleic acid structures in non-canonical conformations are often very accurate for the bases and much less reliable for the backbone, whose conformation could be specified better by including explicit H atom geometry and contacts. The contact dots are an extremely sensitive method of finding problem areas, and often they can suggest how to make improvements. They can also provide explanations for structural features that have been described only as empirical regularities, which is illustrated by showing that the commonest rotamer of methionine (a left-handed spiral, with all χ values near −60°) is preferred because it provides up to five good H atom van der Waals contacts. This methodology is thus applicable in two different ways: (1) for finding and correcting errors in structure models (either experimental or theoretical); and (2) for analyzing interaction patterns in the molecules themselves.},

	abstract = {Small-probe contact dot surface analysis, with all explicit hydrogen atoms added and their van der Waals contacts included, was used to choose between the two possible orientations for each of 1554 asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) side-chain amide groups in a dataset of 100 unrelated, high-quality protein crystal structures at 0.9 to 1.7 Å resolution. For the movable-H groups, each connected, closed set of local H-bonds was optimized for both H-bonds and van der Waals overlaps. In addition to the Asn/Gln “flips”, this process included rotation of OH, SH, NH3+, and methionine methyl H atoms, flip and protonation state of histidine rings, interaction with bound ligands, and a simple model of water interactions. However, except for switching N and O identity for amide flips (or N and C identity for His flips), no non-H atoms were shifted. Even in these very high-quality structures, about 20\% of the Asn/Gln side-chains required a 180° flip to optimize H-bonding and/or to avoid NH2clashes with neighboring atoms (incorporating a conservative score penalty which, for marginal cases, favors the assignment in the original coordinate file). The programs Reduce, Probe, and Mage provide not only a suggested amide orientation, but also a numerical score comparison, a categorization of the marginal cases, and a direct visualization of all relevant interactions in both orientations. Visual examination allowed confirmation of the raw score assignment for about 40\% of those Asn/Gln flips placed within the “marginal” penalty range by the automated algorithm, while uncovering only a small number of cases whose automated assignment was incorrect because of special circumstances not yet handled by the algorithm. It seems that the H-bond and the atomic-clash criteria independently look at the same structural realities: when both criteria gave a clear answer they agreed every time. But consideration of van der Waals clashes settled many additional cases for which H-bonding was either absent or approximately equivalent for the two main alternatives. With this extra information, 86\% of all side-chain amide groups could be oriented quite unambiguously. In the absence of further experimental data, it would probably be inappropriate to assign many more than this. Some of the remaining 14\% are ambiguous because of coordinate error or inadequacy of the theoretical model, but the great majority of ambiguous cases probably occur as a dynamic mix of both flip states in the actual protein molecule. The software and the 100 coordinate files with all H atoms added and optimized and with amide flips corrected are publicly available.},

	abstract = {Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of the insulin and leptin signaling pathways, making it a highly attractive target for the treatment of type II diabetes. For PTP1B to perform its enzymatic function, a loop referred to as the “WPD loop” must transition between open (catalytically incompetent) and closed (catalytically competent) conformations, which have both been resolved by X-ray crystallography. Although prior studies have established this transition as the rate-limiting step for catalysis, the transition mechanism for PTP1B and other PTPs has been unclear. Here we present an atomically detailed model of WPD loop transitions in PTP1B based on unbiased, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and weighted ensemble simulations. We found that a specific WPD loop region─the PDFG motif─acted as the key conformational switch, with structural changes to the motif being necessary and sufficient for transitions between long-lived open and closed states of the loop. Simulations starting from the closed state repeatedly visited open states of the loop that quickly closed again unless the infrequent conformational switching of the motif stabilized the open state. The functional importance of the PDFG motif is supported by the fact that it is well conserved across PTPs. Bioinformatic analysis shows that the PDFG motif is also conserved, and adopts two distinct conformations, in deiminases, and the related DFG motif is known to function as a conformational switch in many kinases, suggesting that PDFG-like motifs may control transitions between structurally distinct, long-lived conformational states in multiple protein families.},

	abstract = {, Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are crucial regulators of cellular signaling. Their activity is regulated by the motion of a conserved loop, the WPD-loop, from a catalytically inactive open to a catalytically active closed conformation. WPD-loop motion optimally positions a catalytically critical residue into the active site, and is directly linked to the turnover number of these enzymes. Crystal structures of chimeric PTPs constructed by grafting parts of the WPD-loop sequence of PTP1B onto the scaffold of YopH showed WPD-loops in a wide-open conformation never previously observed in either parent enzyme. This wide-open conformation has, however, been observed upon binding of small molecule inhibitors to other PTPs, suggesting the potential of targeting it for drug discovery efforts. Here, we have performed simulations of both enzymes and show that there are negligible energetic differences in the chemical step of catalysis, but significant differences in the dynamical properties of the WPD-loop. Detailed interaction network analysis provides insight into the molecular basis for this population shift to a wide-open conformation. Taken together, our study provides insight into the links between loop dynamics and chemistry in these YopH variants specifically, and how WPD-loop dynamic can be engineered through modification of the internal protein interaction network.},

The parent system and the corresponding DPATGK loop species display submicrosecond folding time constants. The mutational studies revealed that ultrafast folding requires both some prestructuring of the loop and a favorable interaction between the chain termini in the transition state. In the case of YY-DPETGT-WY, another submicrosecond folding species [Davis, C. M., Xiao, S., Raleigh, D. P., and Dyer, R. B. (2012) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134, 14476–14482], a hydrophobic cluster provides the latter. In the case of HP7, the Coulombic interaction between the terminal NH3+ and CO2– units provides this; a C-terminal Glu to amidated Ala mutation results in a 5-fold retardation of the folding rate. The effects of mutations within the reversing loop indicate the balance between loop flexibility (favoring fast conformational searching) and turn formation in the unfolded state is a major factor in determining the folding dynamics. The -NAAAKX- loops examined display no detectable turn formation propensity in other hairpin constructs but do result in stable analogues of HP7. Peptide KTW-NAAAKK-WTE displays the same fold stability as HP7, but both the folding and unfolding time constants are greater by a factor of 20.},

	abstract = {Using alternate measures of fold stability for a wide variety of Trp-cage mutants has raised the possibility that prior dynamics T-jump measures may not be reporting on complete cage formation for some species. NMR relaxation studies using probes that only achieve large chemical shift difference from unfolded values on complete cage formation indicate slower folding in some but not all cases. Fourteen species have been examined, with cage formation time constants (1/kF) ranging from 0.9–7.5 μs at 300 K. The present study does not change the status of the Trp-cage as a fast folding, essentially two-state system, although it does alter the stage at which this description applies. A diversity of prestructuring events, depending on the specific analogue examined, may appear in the folding scenario, but in all cases, formation of the N-terminal helix is complete either at or before the cage-formation transition state. In contrast, the fold-stabilizing H-bonding interactions of the buried Ser14 side chain and the Arg/Asp salt bridge are post-transition state features on the folding pathway. The study has also found instances in which a [P12W] mutation is fold destabilizing but still serves to accelerate the folding process.},

The resulting higher resolution crystal structures validate the prior NMR models and provide explanations for experimental observations that could not be rationalized by NMR structural data, including the structural basis for the increase in fold stability associated with motif cyclization and the manner in which a polar serine side chain is accommodated in the hydrophobic interior. A hexameric oligomer of the cyclic peptide is found in both crystal forms and indicates that under appropriate conditions, this minimized system may also serve as a model for protein–protein interactions.},

A Lys–Glu electrostatic pair has been introduced by adding a residue at the beginning and at the end of the N-terminal and C-terminal strands, respectively, of the β-hairpin structure, in both orientations. The two resulting peptides and controls having Ala residues at these positions and different combinations of Ala with Lys, or Glu residues, have been analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), under different pH and ionic strength conditions. All of the NMR parameters, in particular the conformational shift analysis of Cα protons and the coupling constants, 3JHNα, correlate well and the population estimates are in reasonable agreement among the different methods used. In the most structured peptides, we find an extension of the β-hairpin structure comprising the two extra residues. Analysis of the pH and salt dependence shows that ionic pairs contribute to β-hairpin stability. The interaction is electrostatic in nature and can be screened by salt. There is also an important salt-independent contribution of negatively charged groups to the stability of this family of β-hairpin peptides.},

The designed peptides differ only in the amino acid sequence of the putative turn region and have identical strand residues. Our results clearly demonstrate that the turn residue sequence determines the turn conformation and, thereby, other features of the β-hairpin conformation, such as the pattern of interstrand residue pairing and the type of hydrogen-bonding register between β-strand backbone atoms. Furthermore, two key structural factors responsible for the stability of different types of turns were identified. Thus, a side-chain−side-chain interaction between Asn at position i and Thr at position i + 4 stabilizes five-residue turns, whereas a four-residue turn is stabilized when the first residue of the turn has high tendency to populate the αR region of the Ramachandran map. Our results highlight the relevance of turn structures in the early events of protein folding.},

	abstract = {The origin of the stability of isolated β-hairpins in aqueous solution is unclear with contrasting opinions as to the relative importance of interstrand hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and conformational preferences, the latter being associated largely with the turn sequence. We have designed an unconstrained 16-residue peptide that we show folds autonomously in water to form a β-hairpin that mimics the two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet DNA binding motif of the met repressor dimer. The designed peptide, with a type I‘ turn (INGK), is shown by CD and a range of NMR parameters to be appreciably folded (≈50\% at 303 K) in aqueous solution with the predicted alignment of the peptide backbone. We show that the folding transition approximates to a two-state model. The hairpin has a marked temperature-dependent stability, reaching a maximum value at 303 K in water with both lower and higher temperatures destabilizing the folded structure. Van't Hoff analysis of Hα chemical shifts, reveals that folding is endothermic and entropy-driven in aqueous solution with a large negative ΔCp, all of which are reminiscent of proteins with hydrophobic cores, pointing to the hydrophobic effect as the dominant stabilizing interaction in water. We have examined the conformational properties of the C-terminal β-strand (residues 9−16) in isolation and have shown that 3JαN values and backbone intra- and inter-residue Hα-NH NOE intensities deviate from those predicted for a random coil, indicating that the β-strand has a natural predisposition to adopt an extended conformation in the absence of secondary structure interactions. A family of β-hairpin structures calculated from 200 (distance and torsion angle) restraints using molecular dynamics shows that the conformation of the hairpin mimics closely the DNA binding face of the met repressor dimer (backbone RMSD between corresponding β-strands of 1.0 ± 0.2 Å).},

The magnitude of a CD exciton couplet (due to the two Trp residues) and the chemical shifts of a Trp Hε3 site (shifted upfield by 2.4 ppm due to the EtF stacking geometry) provided near-identical measures of folding. CD melts of representative peptides with the -TW-loop-WT- motif provided the thermodynamic parameters for folding, which reflect enthalpically driven folding at laboratory temperatures with a small ΔCp for unfolding (+420 J K-1/mol). In the case of Asx-Pro-Xaa-Thr-Gly-Xaa loops, mutations established that the two most important residues in this class of direction-reversing loops are Asx and Gly:  mutation to alanine is destabilizing by about 6 and 2 kJ/mol, respectively.

Mutations focused on improvement of the direction-reversing loop and the addition of favorable Coulombic interactions at the sequence termini. The loop optimization was based on a database search for residues that occur with the greatest probability in similar hairpin loops in proteins. This search suggested replacing the native DDATKT sequence with NPATGK, which resulted in a 4.5 kJ/mol stabilization of the hairpin fold. The introduction of positively charged lysines at the N-terminus provided an additional 2.4 kJ/mol of stabilization, affording a GB1p mutant that is 86 ± 3\% folded at 25 °C with a melting temperature of 60 ± 2 °C. The trpzip version of this peptide, in which three of the hydrophobic core residues were mutated to tryptophan, yielded a sequence that melted at 85 °C. Throughout, fold populations and melting temperatures were derived from the mutation and temperature dependence of proton chemical shifts and were corroborated by circular dichroism (CD) melts. The study also suggests that the wild-type GB1p sequence is significantly less stable than reported in some other studies:  only 30\% folded in water at 25 °C.},

	abstract = {Here we present a combinatorial approach to evolve a stable β-hairpin fold in a linear peptide. Starting with a de novo-designed linear peptide that shows a β-hairpin structure population of around 30\%, we selected four positions to build up a combinatorial library of 204 sequences. Deconvolution of the library using circular dichroism reduced such a sequence complexity to 36 defined sequences. Circular dichroism and NMR of these peptides resulted in the identification of two linear 14-aa-long peptides that in plain buffered solutions showed a percentage of β-hairpin structure higher than 70\%. Our results show how combinatorial approaches can be used to obtain highly structured peptide sequences that could be used as templates in which functionality can be introduced.},

	abstract = {Detection and characterisation of very weak, non-covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non-fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6 kJ mol−1). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE- and RDC-based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (ΔG, ΔH and ΔS), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.},

	abstract = {Amino acid structural propensities measured in “host−guest” model studies are often used in protein structure prediction or to choose appropriate residues in de novo protein design. While this concept has proven useful for helical structures, it is more difficult to apply successfully to β-sheets. We have developed a cyclic β-hairpin scaffold as a host for measurement of individual residue contributions to hairpin structural stability. Previously, we have characterized substitutions in non-backbone-hydrogen-bonded strand sites; relative stability differences measured in the cyclic host are highly predictive of changes in folding free energy for linear β-hairpin peptides. Here, we examine the hydrogen-bonded strand positions of our host. Surprisingly, we find a large favorable contribution to stability from a valine (or isoleucine) substitution immediately preceding the C-terminal cysteine of the host peptide, but not at the cross-strand position of the host or in either strand of a folded linear β-hairpin (trpzip peptide). Further substitutions in the peptides and NMR structural analysis indicate that the stabilizing effect of valine is general for CX8C cyclic hairpins and cannot be explained by particular side-chain−side-chain interactions. Instead, a localized decrease in twist of the peptide backbone on the N-terminal side of the cysteine allows the valine side chain to adopt a unique conformation that decreases the solvent accessibility of the peptide backbone. The conformation differs from the highly twisted (coiled) conformation of the trpzip hairpins and is more typical of conformations present in multistranded β-sheets. This unexpected structural fine-tuning may explain why cyclic hairpins selected from phage-displayed libraries often have valine in the same position, preceding the C-terminal cysteine. It also emphasizes the diversity of structures accessible to β-strands and the importance of considering not only “β-propensity”, but also hydrogen-bonding pattern and strand twist, when designing β structures. Finally, we observe correlated, cooperative stabilization from side-chain substitutions on opposite faces of the hairpin. This suggests that cooperative folding in β-hairpins and other small β-structures is driven by cooperative strand−strand association.},

Spectroscopic and biophysical methods have been used to characterize the conformational preferences and stability of these peptides, with a strong emphasis on using restraints generated from 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine their three‒dimensional structure. By optimization of inter‒strand interactions, we have developed highly stable disulfide‒cyclized and linear β‒hairpin peptides. In particular, tryptophan residues at non‒hydrogen bonded strand sites (NHB) are highly stabilizing. A variety of turn types have been presented from these scaffolds, suggesting that they might generally be useful in turn presentation. Interestingly, β‒hairpin peptides (containing a disulfide and a NHB tryptophan) have recently been discovered as antagonists of protein–protein interactions from naïve peptide libraries displayed on phage. Comparison of one such β‒hairpin peptide with an α‒helical peptide of very similar sequence provides further insight into the role that residue type and context play in determining polypeptide conformation.},

	abstract = {Many factors influence the stability of hairpins that could appear as foldons in partially folded states of proteins; of these, the propensity of certain amino acid sequences to favor conformations that serve to align potential β-strands for antiparallel association is likely the dominant feature. Quantitating turn propensities is viewed as the first step in developing an algorithm for locating nascent hairpins in protein sequences. Such nascent hairpins can serve to accelerate protein folding or, if they represent structural elements that differ from the final folded state, as kinetic traps. We have measured these “turn propensities” for the two most common turn types using a series of model peptide hairpins with four- and six-residue loops connecting the associated β-strands. Loops of four to six residues with specific turn sequences containing only natural l-amino acids and glycine can provide as much as 15 kJ/mol of hairpin stabilization versus loops lacking the defined turn loci. Single-site mutations within some of the optimal connecting loops can have ΔΔG effects as large as 9–10 kJ/mol on hairpin stability. In contrast to the near universal II′/I′ turns of model hairpins, a number of hairpin-supporting XZZG sequence β-turns with αR and/or γR configurations at the ZZ unit were found. A series of turn replacements (four-residue β-turns replaced by sequences that favor five- and six-residue reversing loops) using identical strands in our model systems have confirmed that several sequences have intrinsic turn propensities that could favor β-strand association in a non-native strand register and thus serve as kinetic traps. These studies also indicate that aryl residues immediately flanking a turn sequence can alter relative turn propensities by as much as 9–11 kJ/mol and will need to be a part of any nascent hairpin recognition algorithm.},

These studies have yielded great insights into the principles governing the stability and folding of β-hairpins and antiparallel β-sheets. This chapter provides an overview of the reported β-hairpin/β-sheet peptides focussed on the applied design criteria, reviews briefly the factors contributing to β-hairpin/β-sheet stability, and describes a protocol for the de novo design of β-sheet-forming peptides based on them. Guidelines to select appropriate turn and strand residues and to avoid self-association are provided. The methods employed to check the success of new designed peptides are also summarized.

Some observations from prior turn capping designs, with further optimization, have provided a generally applicable, “unnatural” beta cap motif (alkanoyl-Trp at the N terminus and Trp-Thr-Gly at the C terminus) that provides a net contribution of 6 + kJ/mol to β-hairpin stability, surpassing all other interactions that stabilize β-hairpins including the covalent disulfide bond. The motif, made up entirely of natural residues, is specific to the termini of antiparallel β-strands and reduces fraying at the ends of hairpins and other β-sheet models. Utilizing this motif, 10- to 22-residue peptide scaffolds of defined stereochemistry that are greater than 98\% folded in water have been prepared. The β-cap can also be used to staple together short antiparallel β-strands connected by a long flexible loop.},

In this context, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of linear water-soluble monomeric peptides able to form the two simplest structural motifs: α-helices and β-hairpins. For both structures, we describe the geometry features, and the main contributions to stability: intrinsic propensities, position dependence of specific residues, particular capping motifs and side chain interactions. They should be considered to design α-helical or β-hairpin peptides. Solvent influence on peptide stability and selected in silico design approaches are also discussed. Moreover, we provide guidelines for structural characterisation of α-helical and β-hairpin-forming peptides by NMR and circular dichroism. We also highlight recently reported designed peptides and current strategies developed to improve their stability, bioactivity and bioavailability.

We have recently reported the design and characterization of a metal-ion-independent 23-residue peptide with a ββα structure (BBA1), based on the zinc finger domains. To understand better the determinants of structure for this small peptide, we investigated the conformational role of the synthetic residue 3-(1,10-phenan-throl-2-yl)-L-alanine (Fen) in BBA1. Results: NMR analysis revealed that replacing the Fen residue of peptide BBA1 by either of the natural amino acids tyrosine (BBA2) or tryptophan (BBA3) resulted in conformational flexibility in the sheet and loop regions of the structure. This conformational ambiguity was eliminated in peptides BBA4 and BBA5 by including charged residues on the exterior of the β hairpin designed to both select against the undesired fold and stabilize the desired structure. The evaluation of two additional peptides (BBA6 and BBA7) provided further insight into the specific involvement of the surface polar residues in the creation of well-defined structure in BBA4 and BBA5. The sequences of BBA5, BBA6 and BBA7 include only one non-standard amino acid (Dproline), which constrains a critical engineered type II′ turn. Conclusions: Manipulation of residues on the exterior of small ββα motifs has led to the design of 23-residue polypeptides that adopt a defined tertiary structure in the absence of synthetic amino acids, increasing the availability and expanding the potential uses of the BBA motif. The importance of negative design concepts to the creation of structured polypeptides is also highlighted.},

Mutagenesis is used to demonstrate the involvement of Trp 64 in the F-actin-binding surface. The latter residue is part of a conserved structural feature, in which the surface-exposed indole ring is stacked on the proline and lysine side chain embedded in a PXWK sequence motif. On the basis of the structural and mutational data concerning Trp 64 reported here, the results of a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis study of full headpiece, and a phage display mutational study of the 69–74 fragment, we propose a modification of the model, elaborated by Vardar and coworkers, for the binding of headpiece to F-actin.},

	abstract = {We report the first high-resolution structure for a protein containing a fluorinated side chain. Recently we carried out a systematic evaluation of phenylalanine to pentafluorophenylalanine (Phe → F5-Phe) mutants for the 35-residue chicken villin headpiece subdomain (c-VHP), the hydrophobic core of which features a cluster of three Phe side chains (residues 6, 10, and 17). Phe → F5-Phe mutations are interesting because aryl–perfluoroaryl interactions of optimal geometry are intrinsically more favorable than either aryl–aryl or perfluoroaryl–perfluoroaryl interactions, and because perfluoroaryl units are more hydrophobic than are analogous aryl units. Only one mutation, Phe10 → F5-Phe, was found to provide enhanced tertiary structural stability relative to the native core (by ∼1 kcal/mol, according to guanidinium chloride denaturation studies). The NMR structure of this mutant, described here, reveals very little variation in backbone conformation or side chain packing relative to the wild type. Thus, although Phe → F5-Phe mutations offer the possibility of greater tertiary structural stability from side chain–side chain attraction and/or side chain desolvation, the constraints associated with the native c-VHP fold apparently prevent the modified polypeptide from taking advantage of this possibility. Our findings are important because they complement several studies that have shown that fluorination of saturated side chain carbon atoms can provide enhanced conformational stability.},

To predict chemical shifts of protein structures, we introduced the UCBShift method that uniquely fuses a transfer prediction module, which employs sequence and structure alignments to select reference chemical shifts from an experimental database, with a machine learning model that uses carefully curated and physics-inspired features derived from X-ray crystal structures to predict backbone chemical shifts for proteins. In this work, we extend the UCBShift 1.0 method to side chain chemical shift prediction to perform whole protein analysis, which, when validated against well-defined test data shows higher accuracy and better reliability compared to the popular SHIFTX2 method. With the greater abundance of cleaned protein shift-structure data and the modularity of the general UCBShift algorithms, users can gain insight into different features important for residue-specific stabilizing interactions for protein backbone and side chain chemical shift prediction. We suggest several backward and forward applications of UCBShift 2.0 that can help validate AlphaFold structures and probe protein dynamics.},

One hypothesis explaining the additional linewidth is that a variety of conformations are in rapid equilibrium at room temperature and become frozen, creating an inhomogeneous distribution at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we investigate conformational heterogeneity by measuring the backbone torsion angle (Ψ) in Escherichia coli Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) at 105 K. Motivated by the particularly broad N chemical shift distribution in this and other examples, we modified an established NCCN Ψ experiment to correlate the chemical shift of Ni+1 to Ψi. With selective 15N and 13C enrichment of Ile, only the unique I60-I61 pair was expected to be detected in 13C’-15N correlation spectrum. For this unique amide, we detected three different conformation basins based on dispersed chemical shifts. Backbone torsion angles Ψ were determined for each basin: 114 ± 7° for the major peak and 150 ± 8° and 164 ± 16° for the minor peaks as contrasted with 118° for the X-ray crystal structure (and 118° to 130° for various previously reported structures). These studies support the hypothesis that inhomogeneous distributions of protein backbone torsion angles contribute to the lineshape broadening in low-temperature NMR spectra.},

Representative snapshots from MD trajectories exhibit variation in predicted 15N chemical shifts of up to 25 ppm. The average over the fluctuations is in significantly better agreement with room temperature solution experimental values than the prediction for any single optimal conformations. Meanwhile, solid-state NMR (SSNMR) measurements of frozen solutions at 105 K exhibit broad lines whose widths agree well with the widths of distributions of predicted shifts for samples from the trajectory. The backbone torsion angle ψi–1 varies over 60° on the picosecond time scale, compensated by φi. These fluctuations can explain much of the shift variation.},

For the purpose of this structure redetermination, undertaken as a test of the minimal function and the SnB program, the identity and sequence of the protein was withheld from part of the research team. A single solution obtained from 1 619 random atom trials was clearly revealed by the bimodal distribution of the final value of the minimal function associated with each individual trial. Five peptide fragments were identified from a conservative analysis of the initial E-map, and following several refinement cycles with X-PLOR, a model was built of the complete structure. At the end of the X-PLOR refinement, the sequence was compared with the published sequence and 57 of the 64 residues had been correctly identified. Two errors in sequence resulted from side chains with similar size while the rest of the errors were a result of severe disorder or high thermal motion in the side chains. Given the amino-acid sequence, it is estimated that the initial E-map could have produced a model containing 99\% of all main-chain and 81\% of side-chain atoms. The structure refinement was completed with PROFFT, including the contributions of protein H atoms, and converged at a residual of 0.158 for 30 609 data with F ≥ 2σ(F) in the resolution range 8.0–0.964 Å. The final model consisted of 518 non-H protein atoms (36 disordered), 407 H atoms, and 129 water molecules (43 with occupancies less than unity). This total of 647 non-H atoms represents the largest light-atom structure solved to date.},

A total of 250 waters, six nitrate ions and three acetate ions, two of which were modelled with alternate orientations were located in the electron-density maps. Three sections of the main chain were modelled in alternate conformations. The room-temperature study produced a model with multiple conformations for eight side chains and a total of 139 water molecules, six nitrate but no acetate ions. The occupancies of the water molecules were refined in both structures and this step was shown to be meaningful when assessed by use of the free R factor. A detailed description and comparison of the structures is made with reference to the previously reported structure refined at 2.0 Å resolution.},

        abstract = {The crystal structure of triclinic hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) has been refined against diffraction data extending to 0.65 Å resolution measured at 100 K using synchrotron radiation. Refinement with anisotropic displacement parameters and with the removal of stereochemical restraints for the well ordered parts of the structure converged with a conventional R factor of 8.39\% and an Rfree of 9.52\%. The use of full-matrix refinement provided an estimate of the variances in the derived parameters. In addition to the 129-residue protein, a total of 170 water molecules, nine nitrate ions, one acetate ion and three ethylene glycol molecules were located in the electron-density map. Eight sections of the main chain and many side chains were modeled with alternate conformations. The occupancies of the water sites were refined and this step is meaningful when assessed by use of the free R factor. A detailed description and comparison of the structure are made with reference to the previously reported triclinic HEWL structures refined at 0.925 Å (at the low temperature of 120 K) and at 0.95 Å resolution (at room temperature).},
